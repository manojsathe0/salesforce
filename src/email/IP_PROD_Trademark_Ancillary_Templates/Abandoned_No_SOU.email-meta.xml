    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Based on the US Patent and Trademark Office’s (USPTO) records, your Trademark application has been deemed abandoned because you did not file a Statement of Use or Request for Extension of Time to File a Statement of Use within the required 6-month period following your Notice of Allowance.

Your Notice of Abandonment was issued on XX/XX/XXXX.  You have two (2) months from that date to file a Petition to Revive for your application, should you decide to continue with the application process.   If you do not file a Petition to Revive, your application will remain abandoned.  If you would like to file a Petition to Revive, additional fees will apply.  Please review the following:

If you did not receive your Notice of Allowance, your Petition to Revive will cost $100.  Once the USPTO receives and approves your Petition to Revive, a new Notice of Allowance will be issued. Please note that this process may take several weeks and we will not be able to complete your Statement of Use order until you receive your Notice of Revived Application.

If you did receive your Notice of Allowance, your Petition to Revive will cost $100 plus $150.00 per class because an Extension Request will be included with your Petition to Revive form, a total of $250.00. This will extend the original expiration date of your Notice of Allowance six additional months and will allow you to submit your Statement of Use at the same time as your Petition to Revive or after the application is revived.
