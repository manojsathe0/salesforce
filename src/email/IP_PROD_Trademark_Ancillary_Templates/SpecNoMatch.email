We have received the specimen and information you submitted for your Trademark filing and have noticed some inconsistent information between the two.  Specifically, the logo on your Trademark filing does not exactly match the logo displayed on the specimen you sent to us.<br/><br/> 

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires that the logo displayed on the specimen be exactly identical to the logo on your Trademark filing.<br/><br/>

To resolve this issue, please reply to this email and select ONE of the following options:<br/><br/> 

1. Submit a new specimen consistent with the logo on your Trademark filing by replying to this e-mail and attaching your file(s) in a .gif, .pdf, .jpeg or .jpg format.  Attachments exceeding 6MB should be uploaded <a href=http://legalzoom.force.com/LZWTC>here</a>.<br/><br/> 
2. Instruct us to file your documents with the specimen you have sent us.  During examination of your documents, if your USPTO examining attorney raises questions regarding this matter, you will be responsible for responding to the request with the appropriate information.<br/><br/>
3. Put your order on hold and consult with an attorney.*<br/><br/>
After reviewing this information, please reply to this email and let me know how you would like us to proceed with your order.<br/><br/>

Please feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.<br/><br/>
