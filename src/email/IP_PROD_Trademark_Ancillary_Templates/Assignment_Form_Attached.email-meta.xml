    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I have attached a sample Trademark Assignment agreement contract.

A Trademark Assignment is the transfer of trademark rights from one or more owners of a mark or marks to someone else. These assignments should be in writing to protect all parties and make clear everyone&apos;s rights going forward. A Trademark transfer is typically accomplished through a contract, like the written agreement form attached.

If you choose to follow the enclosed sample, please read it carefully to make sure it meets all of your needs and that it does not conflict with any other contracts you have in place.  You may make changes to the form as needed, but, just like the form, be sure that those changes accurately reflect the intent of all parties to the contract.

If you have any questions or would like additional information, simply reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
