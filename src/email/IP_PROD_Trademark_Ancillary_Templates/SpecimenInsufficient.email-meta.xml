    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We have received the specimen and information you submitted for your Trademark filing and have noticed some inconsistent information between the two.  Specifically, the goods (products) and/or services reflected in the specimen we received do not appear to reflect the products and/or services as listed on your Trademark filing.

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires that registrants show sufficient proof (called a “specimen”) that the Trademark is currently being used to sell or offer for sale the products and/or services listed in the filing.  Without this proof, the USPTO will deem the mark to have been abandoned.

******************For products******************

For example, if a company has filed an application to register “Bob’s Shoes” and listed “shoes” for its product description, the company could submit a picture of a shoe box or pair of shoes that clearly demonstrated that its mark, “Bob’s Shoes,” is being used in connection with the sale of the products listed in the application.

If you are providing products, acceptable specimens include photographs of packaging labels, clothing tags or labels on containers that prominently display your Trademark. Invoices, order forms, receipts, brochures, catalogs, press releases, business cards, and stationery are generally NOT acceptable specimens for products.

See More Examples

******************For services******************

For example, if a company has filed an application to register “Premier Investments” and listed “investment consultations” for its service description, the company could submit a website screenshot or brochure that clearly demonstrated that its mark, “Premier Investments,” is being used to offer the service described in the application.

If you are providing services, acceptable specimens include a sign, brochure, advertisement, business card, stationary or website prominently displaying your Trademark in connection with the services you’ve listed in your application. The specimen must include a reference to the service, not just the Trademark by itself. Printer’s proofs for advertisements or news articles about your services are generally NOT acceptable specimens for services.
