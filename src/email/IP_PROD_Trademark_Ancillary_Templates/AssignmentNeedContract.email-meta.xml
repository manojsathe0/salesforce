    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

To complete your order, please reply to this email with a copy of your transfer contract(s), preferably in .doc or .pdf format. If you are using a Mac computer or your attachments are larger than 6MB combined, please upload your image(s) directly here.

Your transfer contract should specify the previous and new Trademark owners, as well as the Trademark(s) being transferred. LegalZoom cannot assist in transferring ownership of the Trademark itself; our service is to help you record the transfer of ownership (also known as an assignment) with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). If you would like a sample transfer contract, please let us know.

Please note: LegalZoom will not share your materials with any third party unless necessary for the completion of your order.  Furthermore, LegalZoom does not retain physical copies of your submissions, and will not be held responsible for returning those materials to you.

If you have any questions or would like additional information, simply reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
