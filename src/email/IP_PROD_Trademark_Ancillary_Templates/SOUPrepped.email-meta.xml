    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We have received all your Trademark materials and are working on completing your filing. Shortly, you should expect to receive a time-sensitive email from LegalZoom requesting your electronic signature (e-signature) for your application. The application will include instructions on how to complete your signature.

Please review your application thoroughly before signing. Once it has been signed and filed, most aspects cannot be changed or modified in any way, and all application fees are non-refundable.

Upon confirmation of your e-signature, LegalZoom will complete your order by filing your application with the U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office (USPTO) and paying the required filing fee(s). You will receive a confirmation email which will include your USPTO serial number, which allows you to track the status of your application online.

If you have any questions or would like additional information, simply reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to serving you again soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
