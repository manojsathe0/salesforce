    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

To complete your Trademark filing, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires that you submit proof (called a “specimen”). The specimen you provide should be an actual example that clearly shows how the Trademark is being used in connection with the goods (products) and/or services listed in your filing.

******************For services******************

If you are providing services, acceptable specimens include a sign, brochure, advertisement, business card, stationary or website prominently displaying your Trademark in connection with the services you’ve listed in your Trademark filing. The specimen must include a reference to the service, not just the Trademark by itself. Printer’s proofs for advertisements or news articles about your services are generally NOT acceptable specimens for services.

******************For products******************

If you are providing products, acceptable specimens include photographs of packaging labels, clothing tags or labels on containers that prominently display your Trademark. Invoices, order forms, receipts, brochures, catalogs, press releases, business cards, and stationery are generally NOT acceptable specimens for products.
