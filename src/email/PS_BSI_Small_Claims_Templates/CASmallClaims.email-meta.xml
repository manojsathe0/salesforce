    <textOnly>Dear Valued LegalZoom Customer,
 
Thank you for your interest in the LegalZoom Small Claims Package.  In regards to your question, for the state of California, LegalZoom&apos;s Small Claims service includes the processing and filing of all the documents necessary to bring a small claims case.  The fee for this service is $129 plus an additional $30-75 filing fee depending on your claim amount.  To check for pricing information in the future, please visit www.legalzoom.com, select the desired document on the left-hand side of the homepage, and click on the ?Check Pricing? tab on the document overview page.

After you have completed the online questionnaire and submitted payment, upon request, LegalZoom will mail a demand letter to the defendant on your behalf.  If the defendant does not make payment outside of court, LegalZoom will file the claim in the appropriate courthouse, which is generally located in the county of the defendant?s residence. Once LegalZoom has obtained a hearing date, we will send you the filed documents along with the hearing date and location, and complete instructions on how to serve your defendant.

To obtain more information on Small Claims, you may refer to http://www.legalzoom.com/small-claims-california-guide/small-claims-definition.html or the Small Claims Advisory Board.

Please call us toll-free at (800) 962-7490 if we can be of further assistance.  We look forward to hearing from you soon.
 
Best regards,
 
The LegalZoom Team
