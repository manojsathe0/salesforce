    <textOnly>Dear Valued LegalZoom Customer,
 
Thank you for your interest in the LegalZoom Small Claims Package.  In regards to your question, LegalZoom at this time only offers Small Claims documents for the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, and New York.  

A Small Claims case is generally filed in the state and county of the defendant?s residence, where the event occurred, or the location of the business.  Please refer to the Small Claims Advisory Board in your county?s court office to inquire on more information regarding your case.

LegalZoom at this time does not assist with the claim filing except for claims in the state of California.  In all other states, it will be your responsibility to file the documents and serve the defendant as well.  Your package will include instructions and steps on how to do so. 

To obtain more information on Small Claims, you may refer to https://www.legalzoom.com/legal-small-claims/small-claims-overview.html or the Small Claims Advisory Board.

Please call us toll-free at (800) 962-7490 if we can be of further assistance.  We look forward to hearing from you soon. 
 
Best regards,
 
The LegalZoom Team
