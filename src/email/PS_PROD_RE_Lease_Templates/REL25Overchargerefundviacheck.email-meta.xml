    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 

During a recent systems upgrade, we discovered that some of our customers were overcharged by $[9.95, 10.00, 19.95] when revising their Residential Real Estate Lease.  

You were one of the impacted customers, and as a result, we will be making an unconditional refund to your account in the amount of $[9.95, 10.00, 19.95]. Because we are unable to apply the credit to the original form of payment, we will be providing you with a check. Please allow 5 to 7 business days for processing. The check will be mailed to the contact address on file.

We appreciate the opportunity to serve you and regret the billing error. We hope you will continue to look to LegalZoom for all of your future legal document needs. 

Please contact our Customer Support staff if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. Our Customer Support business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.

Best regards,

LegalZoom Customer Support
