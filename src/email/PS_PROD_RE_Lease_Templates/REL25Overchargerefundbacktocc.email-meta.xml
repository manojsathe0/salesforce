    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 

During a recent systems upgrade, we discovered that some of our customers were overcharged by $[9.95, 10.00, 19.95] when revising their Residential Real Estate Lease.  

You were one of the impacted customers, and as a result, we will be refunding your account the $[9.95, 10.00, 19.95].  This unconditional refund will be issued back to you in the same manner in which it was received. Please allow 5 to 7 business days for this transaction to appear on your account. 

We appreciate the opportunity to serve you and regret the billing error. We hope you will continue to look to LegalZoom for all of your future legal document needs. 

Please contact our Customer Support staff if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. Our Customer Support business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.

Best regards,

LegalZoom Customer Support
