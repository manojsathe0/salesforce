The incorporator&#8217;s name is listed temporarily as President until you file your annual report, which requires you to list in detail information about the appointment of your corporation&#8217;s officers, etc. <br/><br/>Please note however, that the State of Illinois does use &#8220;I&#8221; to acknowledge and distinguish the fact the LegalZoom incorporator&#8217;s name is clearly not the President of your corporation but your &#8220;[I]ncorporator&#8221;. If you need further clarification on this, you can contact the Secretary of State of Illinois (in Chicago) at 312.793.3380.<br/><br/>Here&#8217;s how the President Name is listed currently for [Corporation Name] (up until you file your annual report with the state):<br/><br/>[President Name]<br/><br/>Please also be advised that once your annual report of your corporation has been filed with the Secretary of State of Illinois, the State of Illinois then automatically revises the information related to the listing of the President of your incorporation from the &#8220;Incorporator&#8221; to the actual President of your company.<br/><br/>{!snippetVariable.cccontactline} {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} {!snippetVariable.ccassistline} {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. {!snippetVariable.ourrr} {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} {!snippetVariable.ccbizhourline} {!snippetVariable.cchours}.<br/><br/>{!snippetVariable.ccsincerely}<br/><br/>{!snippetVariable.cclegalzoomline} {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full}<br/>{!snippetVariable.ccphone} | {!snippetVariable.lz_address}<br/>{!snippetVariable.lz_website}<br/></p></div>
