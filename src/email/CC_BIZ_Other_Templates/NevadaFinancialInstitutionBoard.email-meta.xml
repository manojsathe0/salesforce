    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Thank you for your inquiry.

The State of Nevada Financial Institution Regulatory Board enforces regulations and provides licenses to financial institutions in the state. As such, prior to using certain finance-related terms in a business name, an applicant must petition the board for consent.

To obtain consent, complete the following steps:

1. Compose a letter to Deputy Commissioner Steven Kondrup, Las Vegas Office, Nevada Financial Institution Regulatory Board.

2. In the letter, clearly identify the applicant&apos;s name, proposed business name(s), a brief description of the business activity, and the method by which you would like to receive consent or denial.

3. Fax the letter to 702.486.4563, attention to Deputy Commissioner Steven Kondrup, Las Vegas Office.

When you receive consent, fax the letter of consent to our offices at {!snippetVariable.ccbizfax}. However, if the board denies the request, the next step would be to provide us with up to 3 alternate business names so that we can proceed with your order.
