    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry.

LegalZoom cannot advise you on bank rules and procedures.  However, to open an account for your DBA/Business Name, a bank will typically require the actual State or County document verifying your business name was filed. In many cases they will also require a Tax ID number for the business assigned by IRS, however this generally depends on how the DBA is registered. 
 
If the bank requires further documents, please clarify exactly what the bank is looking for, and then follow up with the State or County to obtain these documents.
