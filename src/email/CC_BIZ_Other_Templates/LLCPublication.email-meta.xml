    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry. 

Unfortunately we do not offer publication services for LLCs. As the requirements and procedures for publication are so varied across the country, to ensure your LLC is properly published in your specific area, you would want to contact the county clerk of the county where the business is based for additional information. The county clerk will be able to advise you of the specific requirements, timeline, and acceptable publications in your area.
