    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry.

All states are different when it comes to what information they will share and in what manner.  Appointing a registered agent can offer an extra layer of privacy.  However, it is important to remember that any information filed with the state has the potential to become public and is often listed and sometimes can be purchased on the Secretary of State website.

If you would like to look into having LegalZoom serve as your registered agent for privacy purposes, please contact us at $biz_phone
