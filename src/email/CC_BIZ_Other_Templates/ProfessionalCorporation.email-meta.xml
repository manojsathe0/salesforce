    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry.

In many states, professionals (for example, doctors, lawyers or accountants) who want to incorporate their practices must create what&apos;s called a professional corporation.  The list of professionals required to incorporate as a professional corporation is different in each state. Usually, though, mandatory professional incorporation requirements apply to these professionals:

? Accountants 
? Engineers 
? Health care professionals such as audiologists, dentists, nurses, opticians, optometrists, pharmacists, physical therapists, physicians and speech pathologists 
? Lawyers 
? Psychologists 
? Social workers 
? Veterinarians

You&apos;ll need to call your state&apos;s corporate filing office (usually the Secretary of State or Corporation Commissioner) to see which professions are required to form professional corporations in your own state, or if applicable, contact your licensing board for details.
