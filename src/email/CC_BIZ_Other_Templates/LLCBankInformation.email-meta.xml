    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry.

LegalZoom cannot advise you on bank rules and procedures.  However, most banks generally require the Articles of Organization for your LLC and an IRS Tax ID Number to open an account.
 
If the bank will not accept your articles without additional proof from you, then you may need one or more of the following, depending on your particular state:

. The LLC Operating Agreement (which lists who the owners of the LLC are)
. Proof of Publication
. Fictitious Name Statement
. Statement of Information
. Registration as a foreign LLC in the State the bank is in. 

In this case, please clarify exactly what the bank is looking for, and then follow up with the State to obtain these documents.
