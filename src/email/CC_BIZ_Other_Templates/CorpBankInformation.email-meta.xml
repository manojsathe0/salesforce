    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry.

LegalZoom cannot advise you on bank rules and procedures.  However, most banks generally require the Articles of Incorporation and an IRS Tax ID Number to open an account.
 
If the bank will not accept your articles without additional proof from you, then you may need one or more of the following, depending on your particular state:

. Corporate Bylaws and Resolutions (which list who the owners of the corporation are)
. Proof of Publication
. Fictitious Name Statement
. Statement of Information
. Registration as a foreign corporation in the State the bank is in. 

In this case, please clarify exactly what the bank is looking for, and then follow up with the State to obtain these documents.
