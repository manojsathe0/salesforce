    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry.

Attached is an example of how the certificates should be filled out.  There is a place for the name of the member (owner of a certain percentage), percentage owned, and the date of issuance. The primary member or members of the LLC will sign at the spaces at the bottom (in many cases there may be only one owner of the LLC; in this case it is fine to sign your own certificate).
