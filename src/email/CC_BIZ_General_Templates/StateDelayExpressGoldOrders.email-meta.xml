    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

There is currently a delay of your filing with the state. While we of course process your documents as quickly as possible on our end, the State examination and filing procedure is a factor we cannot control. 

Please note your order is still being expedited so it does get to you as quickly as possible.  You will receive a follow up email to confirm that your name has been filed and the state has sent us back your filed documents. 
 
If you would like to switch to the Standard package, please follow up with us. Otherwise, you will be emailed once the documents have been received back from the State approved.
