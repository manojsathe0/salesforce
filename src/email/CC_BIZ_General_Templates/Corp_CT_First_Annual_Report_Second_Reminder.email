As part of your compliance package, we help ensure your required state filings are completed and filed on time.<br/><br/>
The state of Connecticut requires you to file an annual report for your corporation within 30 days of your company’s organization meeting. <b>Failure to file your documents on time may put your company at risk of revocation or dissolution by the state.</b><br/><br/>
Before we can complete your filings, we need additional information and payment for the state fees. The required state filings fees are listed below*. <br/><br/>
<table border="1" style="font-size: 8pt">
<tr><td><b>Name of Filing</b></td><td><b>State Fee</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>First Annual Report</td><td><center>$150</center></td></tr>
</font></table><i>*Please note that state filing fees are subject to change without notice.</i><br/><br/>
Please sign in to your LegalZoom account <a href="https://www.legalzoom.com/LZWeb/Welcome/SignIn.aspx?TIMESTRING=&iProcess=">here</a> and click the Completed Orders tab. There you can access your compliance package and fill out the Annual Report questionnaire.<br/><br/>
Once you provide the necessary information and fees, we will file your forms with the state.  If you have already provided us with these items, please disregard this email.  This is your second email reminder of this state filing.  LegalZoom processing fees for this filing are included as long as you remain an active compliance member.<br/><br/>
You can reach us at 1 (800) 773-0888, ext. 5208, Monday–Friday from 7 a.m.–6 p.m. PT.<br/><br/>
We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.<br/><br/>
