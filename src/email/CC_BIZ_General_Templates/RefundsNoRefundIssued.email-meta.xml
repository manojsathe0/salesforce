    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry.

We are unable to cancel your order because we have sent your documents to the State for filing. While we of course process your documents as quickly as possible on our end, the State examination and filing procedure is a factor we cannot control. 

Please note your order is still being expedited so it does get to you as quickly as possible. If you would like to switch to the Standard package and have your expediting fee refunded, we are happy to do that for you. Please note that switching to the Standard package will change the turnaround time to 20-35 business days. 

If you would like to switch to the Standard package, please follow up with us. Otherwise, you will be emailed once the documents have been received back from the State approved.
