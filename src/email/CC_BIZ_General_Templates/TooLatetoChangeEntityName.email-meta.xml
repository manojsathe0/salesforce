    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom.com

Please be advised that we cannot change your entity name because your documents have been sent to the Secretary of State for filing. In order to address the requested name change, we need to await filing approval or rejection. An email notification will be sent to your contact email address upon receipt of the documents from the Secretary of State.

Please let us know if you would still like to change your entity name if your current name is filed with the state. Please contact our Business Services Team at {!snippetVariable.bizbsi_phone} {!snippetVariable.bizbsi_hours}.
