    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Thank you for your inquiry

We apologize for any inconvenience but the Microsoft Accounting download is no longer being offered by Microsoft. Unfortunately we cannot offer an alternative download at this time. This feature was offered to our Express Gold customers as a perk and our customers were not charged for the download.

LegalZoom is proud to offer one of the following features for our Express Gold Customers:

? Official Company Seal ($30 value) 
? 20 Customized Membership Certificates 
? Membership Transfer Ledger 
? Priority Rush service, 7-10 business days or less (vs. 20-35 business days for our regular service) 
? Federal Tax ID (EIN) application preparation 
? Two-day FedEx delivery of final package 

Again, we apologize for any inconvenience.
