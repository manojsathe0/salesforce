    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

As part of your compliance package, we help ensure your required state filings are completed and filed on time.

The state of Arkansas requires you to file a franchise tax registration for your corporation shortly after your business has been formed. Failure to file your documents on time may put your company at risk of penalties.

Before we can complete your filings, we need additional information. Please sign in to your LegalZoom account here and click the Completed Orders tab: https://www.legalzoom.com/LZWeb/Welcome/SignIn.aspx?TIMESTRING=&amp;iProcess=. There you can access your compliance package and fill out the State Tax I.D. questionnaire.

Once you provide the necessary information and fees, we will file your forms with the state.  If you have already provided us with these items, please disregard this email.  This is your first email reminder of this state filing.  LegalZoom processing fees for this filing are included as long as you remain an active compliance member.

You can reach us at 1 (800) 773-0888, ext. 5208, Monday–Friday from 7 a.m.–6 p.m. PT.

We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.
