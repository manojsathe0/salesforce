    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for considering LegalZoom for your Intellectual Property needs.

Any time you claim rights in a mark, you may use the TM (trademark) or SM (service mark) designation to alert the public to your claim, regardless of whether you have filed an application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). However, you may only use the federal registration symbol &quot;?&quot; after the USPTO actually registers a mark, and not while an application is pending. Also, you may only use the registration symbol with the mark on or in connection with the goods and/or services listed in the federal trademark registration.

A copyright notice is an identifier placed on copies of the work to inform the world of copyright ownership. It generally consists of the symbol or word ?copyright,? the name of the copyright owner, and the year of publication. For example, an identifier may look like this:

?2003 John Doe
 
While use of a copyright notice was once required as a condition of copyright protection, it is now optional. Use of the notice is the responsibility of the copyright owner and does not require advance permission from, or registration with, the Copyright Office.
