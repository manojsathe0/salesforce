Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
<p>
As part of your Trademark Monitoring Subscription, we monitor the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database for new Trademark applications that may conflict with your Trademark.
<p>
Please review your attached Trademark monitoring report carefully for any listings that you feel are too close to your Trademark. As a Trademark owner, you have the right to file an opposition to any application that you believe might harm your mark or your business. 
<p>
If you would like to file an opposition, you may want to speak first with an attorney about your options. With the <a href= http://www.legalzoom.com/attorneys-lawyers/legal-plans/business.html> Business Legal Plan</a> , you can ask an attorney questions about your specific matter and on an unlimited number of new business or intellectual property matters for a low fee.*
<p>
Please feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.
<p>
We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom. <p>

Best regards, <p>

The LegalZoom Team
