    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

As a Trademark owner, you have the right to oppose any new application that you believe might harm or conflict with your Trademark. If you believe that a proposed Trademark contained in a pending application conflicts with your existing Trademark, it is recommended that you contact an attorney. You can do this quickly, easily and affordably through LegalZoom’s Business Advantage Pro program.
