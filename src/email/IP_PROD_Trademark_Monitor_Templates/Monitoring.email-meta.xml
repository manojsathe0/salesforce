    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

As part of your Trademark Monitoring Subscription, we monitor the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database for new Trademark applications that may conflict with your Trademark.

Please review your attached Trademark monitoring report carefully for any listings that you feel are too close to your Trademark. As a Trademark owner, you have the right to file an opposition to any application that you believe might harm your mark or your business.

If you would like to file an opposition, you may want to speak first with an attorney about your options. With the  Business Legal Plan , you can ask an attorney questions about your specific matter and on an unlimited number of new business or intellectual property matters for a low fee.*

If you have any questions or would like additional information, please call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT or email us at customercare@legalzoom.com.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
