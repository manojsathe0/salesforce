    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom.

LegalZoom’s Trademark Monitoring Service provides a monthly report of Trademark applications recently submitted to the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Please review the report you received for any potential conflicts. If you are the applicant or owner of one of the Trademark applications listed in the report, you can disregard it—your own application cannot pose a conflict to you.

For more information about conflicts, and the “likelihood of confusion,” click here:

If you believe that a proposed Trademark contained in a pending application conflicts with your existing Trademark, you have the right as a Trademark owner to oppose it. It is recommended that you contact an attorney for guidance and you can do this quickly, easily and affordably through LegalZoom’s Business Advantage Pro program.
