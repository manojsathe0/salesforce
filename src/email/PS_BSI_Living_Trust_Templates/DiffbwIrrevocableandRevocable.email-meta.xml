    <textOnly>Dear Valued LegalZoom Customer,

Thank you for your recent inquiry.  In regards to your question, an irrevocable trust is a trust that may not be terminated.  By contrast, a revocable trust may be amended or terminated by the person who created it.

LegalZoom offers three types of revocable Living Trusts: Individual Living Trusts, which are designed for one person, for a price of $249; Joint Living Trusts, which are designed for any two persons, married or not, for a price of $249; AB Living Trusts which are designed only for a married couple to reduce federal estate taxes for a price of $249.  

To check for pricing information in the future, please visit www.legalzoom.com, select the desired document on the left-hand side of the homepage, and click on the ?Check Pricing? tab on the document overview page.

I have included a complimentary ?Living Trust Guide? to help you become more familiar with LegalZoom&apos;s Living Trusts.

Please call us toll-free at (800) 962-7490 if we can be of further assistance.  We look forward to hearing from you soon.
 
Best regards,
 
The LegalZoom Team
