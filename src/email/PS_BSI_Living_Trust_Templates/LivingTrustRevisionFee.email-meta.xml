    <textOnly>Dear Valued LegalZoom Customer,

Thank you for your recent inquiry.  In regards to your question, people normally update their document when life changes arise to accurately reflect their current situation.  In the event you decide to make a revision to your document, each revision through LegalZoom under the Standard Package will be $39.95 after the first 30 days from payment.  The Gold and Vault Packages will include five free revisions for up to five years and will only incur the Shipping and Handling fee of $9.95.  You may make as many changes as you need to on the document within each visit for one revision cost.

Please note that if in the future any real estate properties are purchased, or any financial accounts or businesses are opened that are to be held by the Living Trust, they may be purchased or opened under the Living Trust?s name with the permission of all parties involved.

I have included a complimentary ?Living Trust Guide? to help you become more familiar with LegalZoom&apos;s Living Trusts.

Please call us toll-free at (800) 962-7490 if we can be of further assistance. We look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
