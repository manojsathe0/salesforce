    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry.

Please visit our website and take our free eligibility quiz to see if you are eligible for the type of service that we provide. 

You can find our eligibility quiz by visting http://www.insexperts.com/en/nat/lz/EQ/n400qage.jsp

If you do not pass our free eligibility quiz, it does not necessarily mean that you are not eligible for citizenship. Rather, it simply means that you are not eligible for the type of service that we provide.

You may also want to contact the Bureau of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to explore your options. Please visit the following link:
