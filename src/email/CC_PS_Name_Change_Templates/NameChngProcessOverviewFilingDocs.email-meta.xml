    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry.

Please sign the original copies you received, make copies of those, and take all the copies and the originals to court.  After checking through the actual forms, none of them should have a section requiring a notary unless there&apos;s an issue being addressed outside a regular name change.
