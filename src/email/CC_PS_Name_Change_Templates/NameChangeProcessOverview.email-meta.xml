    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry.

Here&apos;s a brief description of our Name Change services:

Once you have submitted your LegalZoom Name Change order we will process and ship your final documents in about 2 business days. In addition, we will provide you with easy-to-follow instructions on how to submit the paperwork for filing with the court. Generally, most counties take about 30-90 days to finalize your legal name change.

Once your name change has been finalized you will be responsible for changing the name on your social security card, birth certificate, bank accounts etc.
