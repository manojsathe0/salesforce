    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry.

I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, however, since the state of Arkansas no longer accepts our forms, we will not be able to complete this order for you. 

Our billing department will process your refund within 5-7 business days. Please allow a few days for this billing adjustment to appear on your statement.
