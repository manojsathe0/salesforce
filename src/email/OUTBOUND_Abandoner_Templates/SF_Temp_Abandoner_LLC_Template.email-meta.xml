    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for considering LegalZoom to form your business.  

As you know, you’re only few steps away from forming your LLC.   However, I understand you may have questions about our pricing, packages, and overall process.

While LegalZoom has helped form over a million customers, we have not forgotten the importance of helping our customers, one at a time.  

In order to keep our commitment to you, I am making myself available for you to call me directly to answer your questions or even complete your LLC order over the phone.  Our customers are often one or two question away from taking the next steps.  This is where I can guide you through the process.  

Lastly, please also keep in mind that LegalZoom is heavily invested in your success once you have formed your business.  For this reason, we have forged various partnerships through our Small Business Resource Center that will help you run and manage your LLC:  http://businessresources.legalzoom.com/
 
I look forward to hearing from you,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName} 
{!User.Title} 
{!User.CompanyName} 
{!User.Address}
