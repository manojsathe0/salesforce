Thank you for considering LegalZoom to form your business.<br/><br/>

In order to keep our commitment to you, I am making myself available for you to call me directly to answer your questions or even complete your Non-Profit Corporation order over the phone.  Our customers are often one or two question away from taking the next steps.  This is where I can guide you through the process.<br/><br/>  

As mentioned in the subject line, I would be happy to provide a discount promotional code towards your order.  This is a special offer which will be only offered by reaching me directly by calling (877) 677 - 8787 ext. {!User.Extension}.<br/><br/>Lastly, please also keep in mind that LegalZoom is heavily invested in your success once you have formed your business.  For this reason, we have forged various partnerships through our <a href=http://businessresources.legalzoom.com/>Small Business Resource Center</a> that will help you run and manage your Non-Profit Corporation.
