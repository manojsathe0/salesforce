    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for considering LegalZoom to file your Trademark.  

As you may already know, you’re only few steps away from filing your Trademark.   However, I understand you may have questions regarding the overall process, type of package you should choose, pricing and any other concerns you may have.    

To prove how committed we are, I am making myself available for you to call me directly to answer your questions or even complete your Trademark order over the phone.  Our customers are often one or two questions away from taking the next steps.  This is where I can guide you through the process.   

I look forward to hearing from you,
 

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName} 
{!User.Title} 
{!User.CompanyName} 
{!User.Address} 
{!User.Phone} ext. {!User.Extension}
