    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom for your business service needs.

Our company has decided to cancel your order and refund any amounts received.  LegalZoom is a private company that is under no duty to provide its services to the public or any particular individual.  For certain businesses that are heavily scrutinized or regulated, such as insurance, banking, and pharmaceutical-related companies, LegalZoom routinely declines to provide our self-help document service.  Instead, we recommend to our customers that they seek legal representation and advice due to the complexity of their business.
