In regards to your question, you may choose to create a Testamentary Trust in your will. After your death, this trust will take effect. You can use the trust to manage property for your minor children and/or others, including people whom you have designated to receive their share if they have met a specific requirement (e.g. a certain age, graduation from school, etc.).<br/><br/>You can appoint an adult to be the &#8220;trustee&#8221; of your testamentary trust. This person will manage the trust property after your death. If the trust is set up to manage property on behalf of a minor child, the trustee will use his or her reasonable discretion to support the child using the trust property. <br/><br/>I have included a complimentary &#8220;Estate Planning Guide&#8221; to help you become more familiar with LegalZoom&#8217;s documents.<br/><br/>Please call us toll-free at (800) 962-7490 if we can be of further assistance. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br/><br/>Best regards,<br/><br/>The LegalZoom Team<br/>{!snippetVariable.lz_address}<br/>
