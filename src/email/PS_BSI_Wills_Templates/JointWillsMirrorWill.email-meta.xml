    <textOnly>Dear Valued LegalZoom Customer,

Thank you for your recent inquiry.  In regards to your question, LegalZoom at this time does not offer Joint Wills.  A Joint Will is where two people, such as husband and wife, share the same Will.  Joint Wills are uncommon and unpopular for many reasons: With a Joint Will, in the event of one spouse?s passing, half of the couple&apos;s assets may be tied up in probate court until the other spouse passes away.  Furthermore, although a married couple may have most of their property in joint ownership with right of survivorship, that right may not necessarily extend to the designated Executor, Guardian, or Trustee.

For these and other reasons, LegalZoom offers an option of a &quot;Mirror Will&quot;, which is a Will that mirrors another, usually used by spouses.  It is a separate and individual Will, and you will receive the opportunity to create one after the first questionnaire has been completed and paid for.  In addition, a $10 discount will automatically apply to the second Will. 

I have included a complimentary ?Estate Planning Guide? to help you become more familiar with LegalZoom&apos;s documents.

Please call us toll-free at (800) 962-7490 if we can be of further assistance. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
 
Best regards,
 
The LegalZoom Team
