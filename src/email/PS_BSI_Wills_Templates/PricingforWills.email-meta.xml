    <textOnly>Dear Valued LegalZoom Customer,

Thank you for your recent inquiry.  In regards to your question, the following show the prices and features for the different Will packages that LegalZoom offers:

? Basic Package: $69. If you request any revisions to your last will within 30 days from the date of purchase, we make any changes, give it the LegalZoom peace-of-mind review, reprint it on archival-quality paper and mail it to you.
? Comprehensive Package: $99. Includes the same benefits of the Basic package in addition to rush processing and a trial of our Legal Advantage Plan.

Please note that these prices are standard regardless of the amount of information entered for the document.  Furthermore, the content of the document remains the same despite the type of package ordered.  To check for pricing information in the future, please visit www.legalzoom.com, select the desired document on the left-hand side of the homepage, and click on the ?Check Pricing? tab on the document overview page.

I have included a complimentary ?Estate Planning Guide? to help you become more familiar with LegalZoom&apos;s documents.

Please call us toll-free at (800) 962-7490 if we can be of further assistance.  We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
