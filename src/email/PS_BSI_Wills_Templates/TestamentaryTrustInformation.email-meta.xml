    <textOnly>Dear Valued LegalZoom Customer,

Thank you for your recent inquiry. In regards to your question, you may choose to create a Testamentary Trust in your will. After your death, this trust will take effect. You can use the trust to manage property for your minor children and/or others, including people whom you have designated to receive their share if they have met a specific requirement (e.g. a certain age, graduation from school, etc.). 

You can appoint an adult to be the ?trustee? of your testamentary trust. This person will manage the trust property after your death. If the trust is set up to manage property on behalf of a minor child, the trustee will use his or her reasonable discretion to support the child using the trust property. 

I have included a complimentary ?Estate Planning Guide? to help you become more familiar with LegalZoom&apos;s documents.

Please call us toll-free at (800) 962-7490 if we can be of further assistance.  We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
