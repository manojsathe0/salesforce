    <textOnly>Dear Valued LegalZoom Customer,

Thank you for your recent inquiry.  In regards to your question, please follow these steps to create a Mirror Will for your spouse:
 
1. Visit www.legalzoom.com.

2. Click on the &quot;My Account&quot; tab on the top of the page.

3. Enter your email address and your password in the Existing Member Section.  Please make sure to use the email address you previously used when creating the first Will.

4. Click Submit.  You should then be directed to a &quot;Welcome&quot; screen, and you should see your ordered Will below your &quot;Account Profile&quot;.  At the bottom of the page, you should see a section that reads, &quot;Start a New Order.&quot;
 
5. Click on that drop-down menu and select &quot;Wills.&quot;

6. Click on &quot;Get Started.&quot;

7. Click on START next to the top choice, &quot;Start a mirror will...&quot;
  
8. Click through the questionnaire, and make sure to change the designated names, relationships, etc. to reflect your spouse&apos;s wishes. 

I have included a complimentary ?Estate Planning Guide? to help you become more familiar with LegalZoom&apos;s documents.
