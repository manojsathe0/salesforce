    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Please note that your Provisional Application for Patent is divided into 3 main sections:

1. Title: The heading should be short and specific--a maximum of around 15 words. This is not the place for a detailed description of the invention. It also should never include any Trademark name for the invention.

2. Description: In this section, the invention must be explained in full, clear, concise and exact terms. This is the bulk of your application and should provide details for your invention, including what it is, what it does, and the various components involved.

3. Abstract: The purpose of this field is to enable the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the public to quickly determine the nature of your invention. This should be a brief one-paragraph summary of what your invention is and does, and is limited to 150 words.

Please feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.
