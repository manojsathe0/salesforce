    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

You will find a copy of your Provisional Application for Patent attached to this email. Please look over the application thoroughly to ensure that all of the provided information is correct. Once filed, changes cannot be made.

1. If no changes are needed, simply reply to this e-mail with instructions to continue filing as is.
2. If changes are required, please make changes TO THE ATTACHED DOCUMENT*, save it to your computer, and email us the revised document as an attachment with instructions to &quot;apply the changes as attached.&quot;

Although illustrations are not required with your Provisional Application for Patent, it is highly recommended that you include them.

If no response is received within 15 days, we will continue with the filing of your Provisional Application for Patent with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). If more time is needed, simply let us know and we will put your order on hold.
