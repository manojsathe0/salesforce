    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

As requested, I have included a copy of your Provisional Application for Patent, which was filed on MM / DD / YYYY. Attached is a copy of your Final Package documents, including:

1) LegalZoom cover letter
2) The E-filing receipt from the USPTO
3) A copy of your application
4) ADS (Application Data Sheet)
5) A Non-Disclosure Agreement form

Please note that your Provisional Application for Patent is valid for exactly ONE YEAR. You must apply for a corresponding (Non-Provisional) Utility Patent before its expiration, or your early filing date will be forfeited.  To learn more about Utility Patents, please here.

Feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance.  Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}.  Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.
