    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you with providing access to our online database of Legal Forms.  Our Legal Forms database contains over 100 different legal forms for a variety of different business purposes.

It is important to keep in mind that while we do have a database of Legal Forms available, LegalZoom is a document preparation and filing service and not a law firm.  We have a variety of different legal forms, contracts and templates available in our legal forms section available for purchase, but we cannot directly advise you on which form you should purchase to fit the need you have described.

Our forms can range anywhere between $10.00 - $20.00 per form should you see the form you are seeking, however we are also currently offering a special promotion through our Business Advantage Pro (BAP) membership.  This is a subscription service for that will grant you access to all of the forms in our database as long as you are an active subscriber, as well as free attorney consultations to discuss and review the forms to ensure the form will fit your specific situation.  The forms you are requesting may be available in this subscription, and you can browse the available forms prior to subscribing to ensure that the form(s) you need are available.
