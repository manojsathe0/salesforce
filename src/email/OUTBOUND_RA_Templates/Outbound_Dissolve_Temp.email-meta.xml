    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom.com for your business filing needs.  

Per our phone conversation today, I have provided some information and prices regarding the Dissolution services that LegalZoom provides.  

LegalZoom can definitely assist in closing out your registration with the Secretary of State by preparing and filing the Articles of Dissolution.  This will relieve you from having to renew the Registered Agent service with LegalZoom and also any potential future taxes and fees required at the state and federal level.

For your convenience, I have provided our Dissolution packages below.

Standard Package | {!snippetVariable.stddiss_pricing} + $9.95 shipping fee | 20-35 Business Days
Rush Package | {!snippetVariable.rushdiss_pricing} | 7-10 Business Days
