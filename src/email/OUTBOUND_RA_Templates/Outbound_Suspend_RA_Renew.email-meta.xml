Hello {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom.com for your business filing needs.

Per my phone call today, this is a friendly reminder to let you know that your Registered Agent service has been up for renewal for 12 or more months.  Please keep in mind that it is important to have an active Registered Agent to help keep in good standing with your Secretary of State; which protects your privacy and allows your company to receive reliable forwarding service.  As stated over the phone, if not resolved within the next 45 day LegalZoom will be resigning as your Registered Agent on record, which could impact your standing with the Secretary of State.

Please keep in mind as a LegalZoom.com Registered Agent customer; you now have access to many benefits such as:

Dedicated Registered Agent Service Department - Business Advisors that are available to answer general questions about state requirements, legal documents and any other questions regarding your corporate information.
Corporate Center - Exclusive to our Registered Agent customers, easy online access to view your corporate information.
Compliance Calendar and Email Alerts - Included in the Corporate Center, to help keep your business in good standing in meeting various state and federal requirements.


For your convenience, I have provided a summary of our service(s) below for your review.  Please feel free to reach me at anytime for further assistance or to process your renewal.
