    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom.com for your business filing needs.  

Per our phone conversation today, I have provided pricing information for the Annual Report services that LegalZoom provides.  

An Annual Report is a requirement in order for your company to remain in good standing with the Secretary of State.  Most states require either an annual or biannual report for as long as your company exists.

For your convenience, I have provided our Annual Report packages below.
 
Standard Package | {!snippetVariable.stdarpricing} + $9.95 shipping fee | 20-35 Business Days
Rush Package | {!snippetVariable.rusharpricing} | 7-10 Business Days
