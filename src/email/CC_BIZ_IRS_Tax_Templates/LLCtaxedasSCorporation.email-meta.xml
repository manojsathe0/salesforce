    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry.

An LLC formation is by default taxed as a pass-through entity, however it is definitely possible to change this tax-status to that of an S-Corporation. You can make this change by filing for S-corporation election with the IRS using forms 8832 and 2553.  

First you must file to be taxed as a corporation with form 8832.  

Then follow that with form 2553 to be taxed as an S-corporation.  

Both these forms can be downloaded free of charge at the IRS website, www.irs.gov, or you can search at www.google.com for the terms &quot;8832&quot; and &quot;2553&quot;.  If you have further questions please contact a CPA or the IRS directly at 800.829.4933.
