    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry.

The State of California does charge an annual tax of $800.00 in order to have an LLC operate in California. Generally this is due within about 75 days of the original LLC filing date, and is paid to the CA Franchise Tax Board. 

Your final package from LegalZoom includes the Tax Voucher (FTB 3522) which is used to pay this tax. Please complete and file this document with the fee of $800 within 75 days to ensure your LLC stays in good-standing. For further questions about this tax, you would likely want to speak with the Franchise Tax Board directly by calling: 800.852.5711.
