    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry.

We are currently experiencing delays with the IRS which has inhibited our ability to obtain your EIN within the normal turnaround time. The IRS has changed the hours in which we are able to process your EIN application from 3:00am-9:00pm PST to 6:00am-2:00pm PST. Due to these restricted hours, please allow 2-3 business days for the obtainment process to be completed. We will notify you once the EIN has been obtained.

This Application is Available During the Following Hours:

-Monday to Friday 6:00AM to 12:30AM Eastern Time
-Saturday 6:00am to 9:00pm Eastern time
-Sunday 7:00p.m to 12:00 a.m. Eastern time
