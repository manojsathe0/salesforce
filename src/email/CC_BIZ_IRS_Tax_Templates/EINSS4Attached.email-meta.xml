    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry.

Attached is your completed SS-4 Form.  On Form SS-4, the appropriate officer should write in his or her Social Security Number on line 7B if needed, and sign and date it. To obtain the Tax ID Number, call the IRS at 800.829.4933, and they will assign the number to you over the phone. The best time to call is early in the morning or late in the afternoon.  Alternatively, you may fax the signed SS-4 to 215.516.1040, and the IRS will fax the number back to you within 4 business days.  Be sure to include your fax-back number.
