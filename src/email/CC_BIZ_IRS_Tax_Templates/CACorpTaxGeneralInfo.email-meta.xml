    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry.

The State of California does charge an annual minimum tax of $800.00 in order to have a Corporation operate in California. Generally corporations do not have to pay this $800.00 minimum for their first year; taxes paid to the FTB the first year are determined by the actual tax return you file that year with the State and the income made.  

For subsequent years, you would be paying the $800.00 minimum tax to the Franchise Tax Board directly, usually due on April 15th. If taxes on the income of the company equal more than $800.00 in a year, than those taxes would be paid instead of the minimum. For further questions about this tax, you would likely want to speak with the Franchise Tax Board directly by calling: 800.852.5711
