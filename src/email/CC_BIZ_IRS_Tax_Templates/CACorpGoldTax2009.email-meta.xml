    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Thank you for using LegalZoom to create your Corporation.   

Our Business Formation Specialists are preparing to file your Incorporation documents with the Secretary of State.  Before we proceed, we would like you to be aware of your filing options.  The option you choose could significantly affect your state tax obligation for 2007 and 2008.

In California, a minimum annual tax of $800 is assessed on all corporations.  Fortunately, the state waives the fee for a corporation&apos;s first year.   If we send your filing to the state prior to December 18th of this year, your tax waiver will apply to 2007 and the $800 fee will be assessed for 2008.  

However, if we send your filing after December 18th, the $800 fee will not be assessed until 2009.

As a courtesy to our Express Gold Customers, we will delay your order one business day before we proceed, to allow you to opt for a delayed filing.  If you want us to delay your filing until after December 18, please notify us immediately by replying to this email or calling us at 888.381.8758, Monday-Friday, 6:30am - 6:00pm PST and Sat 10:00am ? 2:00pm PST. Otherwise, to avoid delays, if we do not hear from you within one business day, we will proceed with your incorporation order for 2007 as currently scheduled.
