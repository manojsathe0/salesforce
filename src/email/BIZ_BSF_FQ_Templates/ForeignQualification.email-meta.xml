    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom for your Foreign Qualification order.  We have attached the personalized foreign qualification form for your company. In order to ensure your order is processed as quickly as possible, please follow the steps listed below. 

&gt;Ensure that your company is in good standing with all applicable governmental agencies in your company&apos;s state of formation (Secretary of State, Tax Board, etc). We will not be able to proceed with the filing unless your company is in good standing.
&gt;Print two (2) copies of the form on white paper using black ink only.  
&gt;Sign your name in black ink on all copies as indicated. 
&gt;Do not make any changes to the attached foreign qualification form as it could delay your order.  If you need to make changes, please contact our Customer Care Team.
&gt;Mail the signed forms to our address listed below. (Please ensure to mail the forms to LegalZoom for processing and not the Secretary of State or other government office as doing so may delay your order.)
