    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

I’m sorry that I was unable to reach you. I was just calling to check in with you and get an update on your business. As your Account Manager, if there is anything I can help you with, please don’t hesitate to give me a call, and I will be happy to assist you. It has been a pleasure working with you.

Please call me directly at (855) 787-1958 x{!User.Extension} Monday–Friday from 6 am – 6 pm PT or simply reply to this message.  If I’m unavailable, you can also email QuickStart@legalzoom.com to reach the next available member of my team.

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
