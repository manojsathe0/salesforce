    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations, we have successfully completed the process of placing your order. Your order confirmation number is #---. This number can be used to reference your order anytime.

Per our cursory name check, your entity name appears to be available. However, a more thorough check will still be done by a specialist in the business division to determine if the entity name appears available on preliminary basis. Please keep in mind that an entity name is not confirmed to be available until it is filed by your respective state.
