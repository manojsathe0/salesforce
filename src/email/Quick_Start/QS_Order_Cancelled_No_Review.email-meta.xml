    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

I’m sorry that we have not been able to complete the review of your order with you. This step is required to ensure we have the information necessary to form your business.

Unfortunately, we do not have enough information to proceed in the filing of your company with the state. I have cancelled your order and issued a full refund to your original form of payment. If you would like to replace your order please contact me at the number below so that I may continue to assist you on this journey to establishing your business.

If you have any questions or concerns, please call me directly at (855) 787-1958 x{!User.Extension} Monday–Friday from 6 am – 6 pm PT or simply reply to this message.  If I’m unavailable, you can also email QuickStart@legalzoom.com to reach the next available member of my team.
