    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

We were unable to reach you to complete the review of your business formation details with you.

Starting a business can be hectic, and I know it can be difficult to find time in a busy schedule.  This review is important as we cannot move forward with your business formation until we have gathered the remaining information necessary for filing.

To complete your review, please call me directly at (855) 787-1958 x{!User.Extension} Monday–Friday from 6 am – 6 pm PT or simply reply to this message.  If I’m unavailable, you can also email QuickStart@legalzoom.com to reach the next available member of my team.

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
