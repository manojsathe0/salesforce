Congratulations!  You have taken a big step towards starting your new business.  LegalZoom has made business formations fast and easy for customers for over 12 years, and I am confident we can help you get off to a great start.

The next step in the process is for us to review your information and gather the remaining details to begin the formation of your company.  We need to complete this review before we can move forward with your order.

If you have any questions or you are ready to schedule your review, please call me directly at (855) 787-1958 x{!User.Extension} Monday–Friday from 6 am – 6 pm PT or simply reply to this message.  If I’m unavailable, you can also email QuickStart@legalzoom.com to reach the next available member of my team.

As your dedicated Account Manager, I&apos;ll be your primary point of contact for all your business formation needs.  My commitment to you is this – I will do whatever possible to help make sure you have the right information and access to the right resources to make the best decisions for your future success.
