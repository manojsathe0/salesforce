    <textOnly>Dear Valued LegalZoom Customer,

Thank you for your recent inquiry.  In regards to your question, LegalZoom offers a Real Estate Deed Transfer service that allows you to add, remove, or transfer titles or ownership on the deed of a real estate property.  This service varies between $269-479 per real estate property depending on the state in which the property is located.  This fee covers the preparation of the deed, the filing and recording of the deed with the county, as well as the county filing fees.  

To check for pricing information for your state, please visit www.legalzoom.com, select ?Living Trusts? on the left-hand side of the homepage, and click on the ?Check Pricing? tab on the document overview page.

To get started, visit LegalZoom and complete an online questionnaire: https://www.legalzoom.com/real-estate-deed-transfer/real-estate-deed-transfer-overview.html

Please note that if the house is owned by more than one person, and one of the owners is deceased, a separate document normally must also be prepared, usually called an &quot;Affidavit Terminating Joint Tenancy.?  LegalZoom will be able to prepare and record this affidavit for the same fee (additional) as the deed transfer.

Please call us toll-free at (800) 962-7490 if we can be of further assistance.  We look forward to hearing from you soon.
 
Best regards,
 
The LegalZoom Team
