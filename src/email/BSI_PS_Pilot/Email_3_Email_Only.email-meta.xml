    <subject>Is your [will/living trust/living will] up-to-date?</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

If you’ve had any recent life changes, such as having a baby, purchasing a new home or moving to a new state, now may be a good time to revise your [will/living trust/living will].  Simply sign in to your account, go to your completed orders and click “revise.”

Not sure what you might need to change?  Have an attorney review your estate plan. Learn more.

Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. Just give us a call at (866) 679-0483
