    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


Sorry we didn’t connect on the phone. It’s been a while since you purchased your will, and we wanted to share some additional information you may find useful to help ensure your family stays protected:


Living Will: Specify medical instructions

Power of Attorney: Appoint someone to make financial decisions on your behalf

Legal Advice from an Attorney: Have an attorney review your estate plan

Living Trust: Avoid probate-related expenses and delay


Real Estate Deed Transfer: Add or remove a person’s name from your property title or place your property in a living trust.



Please feel free to call me back directly or reply to this email if you have a couple minutes to speak.



Best regards,

{!User.FirstName}
