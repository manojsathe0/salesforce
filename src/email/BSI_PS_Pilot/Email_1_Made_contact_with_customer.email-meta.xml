    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},


It was great speaking with you earlier today.


I wanted to share some links you may find useful to help ensure your family stays protected:


Living Will: Specify medical instructions

Power of Attorney: Appoint someone to make financial decisions on your behalf

Legal Advice from an Attorney: Have an attorney review your estate plan

Living Trust: Avoid probate-related expenses and delay


Real Estate Deed Transfer: Add or remove a person’s name from your property title or place your property in a living trust.



Again, thank you for your time today, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.



Best regards,
