    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope you found your business formation consultation informative and helpful. I am now working with the attorney to create your personalized Business Starter Roadmap with easy-to-follow recommendations to get your business entity up and running.

As a business owner, I know it can be difficult to maintain your busy schedule. However, this Roadmap Review is important to allow you to review the attorney recommendations to establish your business.

If you have any questions or would like to schedule your review, please call me directly at (855) 787-1951 x{!User.Extension}, Monday–Friday from 6 am – 6pm PT or simply reply to his message. If I’m unavailable, you can also email bizhelp@legalzoom.com to reach the next available member of my team.

Thank you for reaching out to the LegalZoom Business Starter Team. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
