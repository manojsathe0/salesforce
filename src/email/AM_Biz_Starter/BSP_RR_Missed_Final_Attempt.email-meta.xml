    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I have attempted multiple times to contact you to review your Roadmap together.  Since I believe you will benefit greatly from the information, I have attached your copy for you to review.

If you have any questions about the Roadmap, I would still be happy to assist you and schedule a time to review the Roadmap together. I do want to remind you that if you contact me directly to move forward with your business formation, you will receive a discount since you had an attorney consultation.

Thank you again for reaching out to the LegalZoom Business Starter Team, I hope you are doing well.
