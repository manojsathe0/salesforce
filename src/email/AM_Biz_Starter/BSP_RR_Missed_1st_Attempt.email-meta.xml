    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I was unable to reach you for your Roadmap Review at your scheduled time: DATE-TIME

As a business owner, I know it can be difficult to maintain your busy schedule. However, this Roadmap Review is important—it will allow you to better understand the attorney’s recommendations, as well as demonstrate how LegalZoom can help successfully launch your business.

If you have any questions or you are ready to reschedule your Roadmap Review, please call me directly at (855) 787-1951 x{!User.Extension}, Monday–Friday from 6 am – 6pm PT or simply reply to his message. If I’m unavailable, you can also email bizhelp@legalzoom.com to reach the next available member of my team.

As your dedicated Account Manager, I&apos;ll be your primary point of contact for all your business formation needs. Thank you again for reaching out to LegalZoom. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
