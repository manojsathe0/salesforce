    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry.

The Document Request Form is used to transfer a real estate property into the Living Trust. We realize that the documents you received may cause some confusion. Please allow me to clarify the procedure. 
 
First, please write down the date that the Trust was notarized on the Document Request Form. 
 
Sign the bottom of the page.  If this is a Joint or AB Living Trust, both Grantors will need to sign the bottom of this page.
 
Leave the Payment Form Blank.  You have already paid the money to LegalZoom, and LegalZoom in turn paid the North American Deed Company. 
 
Then, make sure names are spelled correctly on the Disclosure Statement, and sign it. Again, if this is a Joint or AB Living Trust, both Grantors will need to sign the bottom of this page.

Once this is done, please fax it to 1.702.736.7990.

For further assistance with the deed transfer, please contact the North American Deed Company at 1.888.715.6400.
