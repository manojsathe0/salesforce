    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Attached please find your Self-Proving Affidavit, prepared at your request.  Your initial order did not include this affidavit because your state either does not require or recognize a Self-Proving Affidavit or one was not available.

LegalZoom cannot guarantee the validity of the document and its effect on your Last Will and Testament. You may want to consult with an attorney.  For help finding an attorney in your area, please refer to:  http://attorneyconnect.legalzoom.com
