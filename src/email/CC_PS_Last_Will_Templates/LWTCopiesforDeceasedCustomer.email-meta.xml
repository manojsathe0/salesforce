    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
 
Thank you for your inquiry. 

Please accept our condolences for your recent loss. To ensure the privacy of our customers, LegalZoom.com employs certain security measures on all of our legal documents. Accordingly, we can only provide a copy of a customer?s last will to the executor named in the will. We also require a copy of the death certificate prior to issuing the copy.

Please note that only a validly-executed will can go through the probate process, and an unsigned copy of the original will is not considered valid.
