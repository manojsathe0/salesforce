    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry.

If you make any revisions within 30 days from the date of purchase, you will only be charged a $9.95 shipping and handling charge.  If you make revisions after 30 days, each revision will be $29.95 (including shipping and handling).

You may want to upgrade to the Gold package for an additional $30.00, and then you will have unlimited Free Revisions for up to five (5) years, with just a $9.95 shipping and handling charge for each revision.
