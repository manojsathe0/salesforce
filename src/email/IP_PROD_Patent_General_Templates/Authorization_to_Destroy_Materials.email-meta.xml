    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Now that your {insert type of order) application has been filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), we need to know what you would like us to do with your materials. Following USPTO guidelines, we scanned or photographed your materials and electronically submitted your registration. At this point, we no longer need to retain the materials you sent to us.

If you would like us to return them to you, please provide your mailing address. If you do not want your materials back, please confirm that you would like us to destroy them. 

Please feel free to contact our Customer Care Team if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at 1.800.773.0888. Our Customer Care Team business hours are Monday through Friday, 6:00am to 7:00pm Pacific Time.

We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
