    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom. 

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is currently offering the Green Technology Pilot Program for inventions that improve environmental quality, increase energy conservation, assist in the development of renewable energy resources, reduce greenhouse gas emissions or provide some other benefit to the environment.  If an application is accepted by the USPTO for the Pilot Program, it could be examined in far less time than non-qualifying applications, saving you anywhere from a few months to a year or even more.

For more information about this program or to download the application form, please visit:

If you have any other questions, simply reply to this email or contact our customer care team at (800) 773-0888 Monday-Friday from 6 a.m.-7 p.m. PT.

Best Regards,

The LegalZoom Team
