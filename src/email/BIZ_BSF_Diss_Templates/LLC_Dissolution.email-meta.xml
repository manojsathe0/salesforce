    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom for your Dissolution order. Attached, please find your customized Dissolution documents. In order to ensure your order is processed as quickly as possible, please follow the steps listed below. 

•  Please ensure that your company is in good standing with all applicable governmental agencies (Secretary of State, Tax Board, etc). 

•  Print two (2) copies of the document on white paper using black ink only. 

•  Sign your name in black ink on all copies as indicated. 

•  Do not make any changes to the attached document(s) as it will result in delays with your order. If you need to make changes, please contact our Customer Support.

•  All members must sign the attached Action by Unanimous Written Consent. Once signed, this document is the members’ written approval of the dissolution of the LLC. If your LLC was not formed through LegalZoom, please check your operating agreement to ensure that the members may act by written consent. You don&apos;t have to mail this form back to LegalZoom, but keep it for your records.

•  Mail the documents (except for the Action by Unanimous Written Consent) to our address listed below. Please note that we cannot accept faxes as the state office will only accept original signed documents.
