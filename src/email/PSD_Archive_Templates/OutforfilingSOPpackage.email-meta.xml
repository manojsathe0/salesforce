    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We have received your signed documents and expedited your claim to the court for filing. The court generally provides hearing dates within 10-14 days of filing. We will keep you informed if there are any delays.

While your claim is being filed with the court, please take some time to familiarize yourself with Service of Process. A small claims filing requires you to serve your claim documents on your defendant before your claim can be heard in court. 

For your convenience, we have attached a guide with complete, detailed instructions on proper service of process to this email. This informative guide includes different options for you to consider when preparing to serve your defendant.

If you would like assistance with serving your defendant we have included a list of local certified process servers in your area or you may visit www.napps.org (National Association of Professional Process Servers) to research and select a process server.

Please review the information and don&apos;t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions, {!snippetVariable.ccphone} {!snippetVariable.cchours}.

We truly appreciate your business and look forward to serving your future legal document needs.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
