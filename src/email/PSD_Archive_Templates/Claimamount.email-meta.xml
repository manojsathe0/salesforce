    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent Small Claims order with LegalZoom.

During my review of the information you submitted, I noticed a discrepancy in the amount of damages you requested. 

As you may have read in our Education Center, the maximum amount that an individual may claim in California Small Claims court is $7,500, and the maximum for a corporation, LLC or DBA is $5,000. Any claim over that amount must be brought in Superior Court.

If you have any further questions, please simply reply to this email, or feel free to call us toll-free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone} {!snippetVariable.cchours}.

We truly appreciate your business and look forward to serving your future legal document needs.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
