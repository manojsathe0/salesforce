    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName}:

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom to prepare your Last Will and Testament.

Many of our Last Will customers also prepare a Living Will to protect their health care wishes in case of a medical emergency.

Your Last Will specifies who will inherit your property. A Living Will specifies whether or not you would like to remain on life support should you become incapacitated. LegalZoom&apos;s Living Wills include a Health Care Power of Attorney, which allows you to name someone to make medical decisions on your behalf. 

Documenting your wishes in advance helps avoid family conflict and spares your loved ones from making these difficult choices for you.

For more information on Living Wills, click here: http://www.legalzoom.com/law_library/living_wills/introduction.html

To prepare a customized Living Will, simply log back into LegalZoom and complete our easy-to-follow questionnaire. Our specialists will take care of the rest.

If you have any additional questions, simply reply to this email or call us toll-free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone} {!snippetVariable.cchours}. We appreciate your business and look forward to serving your future legal document needs.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
