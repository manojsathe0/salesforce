    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent order.

Our records indicate that you have placed an order for a [county or state] Name Change package. Unfortunately, LegalZoom does not prepare Name Change documents for residents of [county or state] at this time, and we will not be able to assist you with this order.

Our billing department will process your refund within 5-7 business days. Please allow a few days for this billing adjustment to appear on your statement.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email or call us toll-free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone} {!snippetVariable.cchours}.

Thank you once again for contacting LegalZoom, America&apos;s #1 online legal source.
