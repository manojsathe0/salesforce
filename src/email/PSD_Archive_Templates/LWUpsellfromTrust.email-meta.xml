    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName}:

You are receiving this message because you recently completed a LegalZoom Living Trust order in which you gave specific directives concerning life support and/or health care.

Perhaps you may be interested in a different document that we provide in addition to your Living Trust.  In fact, many of our customers who order a Living Trust, also order a Living Will to protect themselves on all levels, and gain added peace of mind.

A Living Trust and a Living Will are two distinct documents, both extremely important. 

A Living Trust ensures that your wishes regarding your estate are carried out while avoiding probate court. For more information, click here:

A Living Will goes into effect if you are rendered unconscious and unable to communicate your wishes regarding life support and care. The LegalZoom Living Will comes standard with a Health Care Power of Attorney which also allows you to nominate someone to make these decisions for you if you are incapacitated.

Should you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us at 800-773-0888 or at customersupport@legalzoom.com. Thank you.
