    <textOnly>Dear Valued LegalZoom Customer,

Thank you for your recent inquiry.  In regards to your question, LegalZoom offers Minor Name Change documents for $165 that cover the proper and thorough preparation of the appropriate documents necessary to file with the county clerk office.  Please note that this fee does not cover any filing fees or publication fees.  You may refer to your local court to inquire on information pertaining to filing fees and other third party fees.  

At this time, we do not offer Minor Name Change documents for the locations of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Wyoming, Guadalupe County (TX), Jackson County (OR), and Palm Beach County (FL).  If you are in the mentioned states, you may refer to the county court office to inquire on the availability of these forms or visit https://www.legalzoom.com/attorneys-lawyers/legal-plans/personal for an attorney referral.

Please also note that our Minor Name Change documents require the signatures of both biological parents unless one parent is deceased or whose parental rights have been terminated as determined by the courts.  If this is not the situation, please refer to the county court office to inquire on the options available to you, or a local attorney.

To get started, simply log onto www.legalzoom.com and complete the online questionnaire.  In 2-3 business days, LegalZoom will create your documents and mail them to your address through First Class Shipping with instructions.  The documents will then be ready to be filed with the county court office.
