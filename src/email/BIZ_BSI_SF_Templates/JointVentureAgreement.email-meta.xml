    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business services needs. In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you to prepare a Joint Venture Agreement and make the process easy for you. 

A joint venture is an agreement between parties for a specific purpose or venture. The Joint Venture Agreement is a written document that contains important information such as the parties involved, the duties and rights of each party, the distribution of profits, and the governing laws. The Joint Venture Agreement must be signed by each party involved. 

For your convenience, I have provided the Joint Venture Agreement fee and the link to get started below.
