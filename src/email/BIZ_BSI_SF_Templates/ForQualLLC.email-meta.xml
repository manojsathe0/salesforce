    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business services needs.  In regard to your inquiry, a Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a state-specific business entity; as such, it is only recognized in the state in which it is registered.  If you would like your LLC to be authorized to do business as an LLC in multiple states you may do so through a process called Foreign Qualification.  

Foreign Qualification is the process of obtaining authority to do business outside of the state in which an LLC is registered.  Doing business includes, but is not limited to, applying for licenses or permits, opening a business bank account, owning property, and hiring employees.  

LegalZoom can assist in the process of Foreign Qualification by obtaining a Certificate of Good Standing from the state of formation, as well as filing LLC formation documents in the foreign state.  

For your reference, I have provided the fees and link to our Foreign Qualification service below:

FOREIGN QUALIFICATION
Standard Package | $229.00 + combined state fees + shipping (20 - 35 business days)
Rush Package | $339.00 + combined state fees (7 - 10 business days)
