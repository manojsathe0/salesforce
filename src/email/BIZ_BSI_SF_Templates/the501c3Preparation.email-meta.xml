    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business services needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist in preparing a 501(c)(3) Application to apply for tax-exempt status with the IRS for your existing Non-Profit Corporation.

Our 501(c)(3) Application Preparation service consists of an online questionnaire that will ask you for information about the directors and officers, the activities that will be conducted, and your estimated annual income and expenses. 

Please be aware, however, that you are responsible for filing the prepared 501(c)(3) Application with the IRS.  The IRS will take anywhere between 3 - 6 months to approve you application and will charge its own filing fee.  If your estimated annual income for your first four years is less than $10,000, the filing fee will be $400.00.  If your annual income is $10,000 or more per year, the filing fee will be $850.00.

If you apply for 501(c)(3) status within 27 months of your initial date of incorporation in your state, you will typically be retroactively tax-exempt from that date. 

501(c)(3) APPLICATION PREPARATION
Standard Package | $595.00 + shipping (20 - 30 business days)
Rush Package | $795.00 (7 - 10 business days)
