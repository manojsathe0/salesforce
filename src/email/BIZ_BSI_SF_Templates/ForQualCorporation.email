  <td style="padding:15px 15px 15px 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:11.5px; line-height:17px; border:1px solid #CCCCCC;">Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},<br/><br/>Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business services needs. In regard to your inquiry, a Corporation is a state-specific business entity; as such, it is only recognized in the state in which it is registered. If you would like your Corporation to be authorized to do business as a Corporation in multiple states you may do so through a process called Foreign Qualification. <br/><br/>Foreign Qualification is the process of obtaining authority to do business outside of the state in which a Corporation is registered. Doing business includes, but is not limited to, applying for licenses or permits, opening a business bank account, owning property, and hiring employees. <br/><br/>LegalZoom can assist in the process of Foreign Qualification by obtaining a Certificate of Good Standing from the state of formation, as well as filing Incorporation documents in the foreign state. <br/><br/>For your reference, I have provided the fees and link to our Foreign Qualification service below:<br/><br/>FOREIGN QUALIFICATION<br/>Standard Package | $229.00 + combined state fees + shipping (20 - 35 business days)<br/>Rush Package | $339.00 + combined state fees (7 - 10 business days)<br/><br/>TO GET STARTED, click <a href=http://www.legalzoom.com/additional-business-services/foreign-qualifications-for-business.html>here</a>.<br/><br/>Please feel free to contact us at (888) 381-8758 if you have any further questions. Our Business Formations Team business hours are {!snippetVariable.bizbsi_hours}.<br/><br/>Best regards,<br/><br/>{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}<br/>
