In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you to prepare a General Partnership Agreement and make the process easy for you. <br/><br/>A general partnership is formed when two or more people agree to conduct business together. The General Partnership Agreement is a written document that contains important information such as the people involved, the duties and rights of each partner, the distribution of profits, and the governing laws. The General Partnership Agreement must be signed by each partner involved. <br/><br/>For your convenience, I have provided the General Partnership Agreement fee and the link to get started below.<br/><br/>General Partnership Agreement | $129.00<br/><br/>TO GET STARTED, click <a href=http://www.legalzoom.com/partnership-agreement/partnership-agreement-overview.html>here</a>.<br/><br/>Please feel free to contact us at (888) 381-8758 if you have any further questions.
