    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business services needs. In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you to complete the seller&apos;s permit/state tax ID application.  This service may be purchased as an optional service to our business formation packages in certain states or as part of the Business License Package. 

If you have not registered your business, there are a few filing options you have in order to start your business -- most of our customers opening a small business choose to register their business name by filing a DBA, a Corporation, or an LLC. If you would like to research more information regarding these different structures, you may visit http://www.legalzoom.com/business-formations/summary-compare-business-formations.html for more information on the differences between each type of filing.

If you have already registered your business, LegalZoom provides a Business License Package that will do the research and obtain the applications for any required licenses and permits. You may visit http://www.businesslicenses.com/lz_blcp_73008 for more information on the Business License package.

Please feel free to contact us at (888) 381-8758 if you have any further questions.  Our Business Formations Team business hours are {!snippetVariable.bizbsi_hours}.
