    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

LegalZoom is not an attorney and cannot provide legal advice. However, we are always seeking innovative ways for people to get the benefits of the law. While we offer a wide variety of documents and services, people often need the advice and guidance of an attorney.

Please visit the link to our Legal Advantage Plus product offering to learn more about getting advice addressing your personal legal needs from an experienced attorney.
