    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

The search report you received was based on the invention information and drawings you provided within your order, and  includes pending and issued patents with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

If you are unsatisfied with your search results, we are more than happy to have a new search conducted - however, you will need to provide us with additional drawings and descriptions that will help us better understand the claims made for your invention. To do so, simply reply to this email with your updated information.

Please feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance.  Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}.  Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.

Thank you again for choosing LegalZoom.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
