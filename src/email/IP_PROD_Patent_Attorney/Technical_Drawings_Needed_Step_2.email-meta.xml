    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

As part of your Utility Patent application, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires drawings of your invention wherever necessary for your examiner to understand your invention. Our records show that you have not provided drawings of your invention as part of your application.

Please visit the following links for more information on the USPTO standards for patent drawings:

Content of drawing. - Appendix R Patent Rules

Standards for drawings. - Appendix R Patent Rules

LegalZoom offers a Patent Illustration Service: you and your assigned Patent attorney or agent work with Professional Patent Illustrators to make sure your drawings meet the USPTO’s standards and show your invention to its best advantage. For more information, visit:

Professional Patent Drawings Overview

Please reply to this email to let us know how you would like to move forward: (1) Work with your Patent Agent or attorney and Professional Illustrators to create professionally-drafted Patent Illustrations to accompany your application; (2) Submit your own drawings to us and we will forward them to your Patent Professional along with the rest of your materials; or (3) Continue with your application as-is, if you believe that your invention can be understood without any drawings.

Please note: In no case does LegalZoom share your materials with any third party not necessary for the completion of your order.  Furthermore, LegalZoom does not retain physical copies of your submissions, and will not be held responsible for returning those materials to you. Submitted physical materials are securely destroyed.
