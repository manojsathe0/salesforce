Please send these materials by attaching them to your reply email (preferably in .gif, .pdf, .jpeg or .jpg format). If your document(s) file size exceeds 8MB, it is best that you upload your materials directly by uploading it here: http://legalzoom2.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/legalzoom2.cfg/php/enduser/ask.php .

Otherwise, you can send it by mail it to:
