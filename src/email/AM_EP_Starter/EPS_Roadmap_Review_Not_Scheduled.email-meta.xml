    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope you found your consultation with [ATTORNEYNAME] informative and helpful.  [ATTORNEYFNAME] is working to create your personalized Estate Planning Roadmap with easy-to-follow recommendations.

Your personalized Roadmap will be ready on: [DATE]

I would like to set up a quick discussion with you to discuss items on the Roadmap  that I can help you with.

To schedule a time for this, please call me directly at (888) 269-8232 Monday–Friday from 8 a.m.–5 p.m. PT or simply reply to this message. If I’m unavailable, you can also email MakeAPlan@legalzoom.com to reach the next available member of my team.

As your dedicated account manager, I&apos;ll be your primary point of contact for all your needs. My commitment to you is this—I will do whatever possible to help make sure you have the information you need to make the best decisions for yourself—and hopefully, I can also help save you money in the process!

Finally, John asked that I send you a copy of the limited scope agreement for the consultation and Roadmap. There is nothing you need to do—it is just provided for your records.

Thank you for reaching out to the LegalZoom Personal Services Team. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
