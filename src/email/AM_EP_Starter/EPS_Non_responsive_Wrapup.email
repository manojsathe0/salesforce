Dear {!Contact.FirstName},<br><br>
Thank you again for giving me the opportunity to discuss your estate planning roadmap.<br><br>
Having helped many people I understand that choosing estate planning documents is a big decision and sometimes takes weeks and even months before you feel comfortable enough to move forward.<br><br>
Along the way, please understand that I am available to answer any questions that may come up and my commitment to you remains unchanged--- to do whatever possible to help make sure you have the information you need to make the best decisions for yourself —and hopefully, save you money in the process!<br><br>
I am available at (888) 269-8232 Monday–Friday from 8 a.m.–5 p.m. PT or simply reply to this message. If I’m unavailable, you can also email MakeAPlan@legalzoom.com to reach the next available member of my team.<br><br> 
Finally, if you prefer for me to remove you from my contact list, please just let me know as I want to respect your time.<br>
<br>
