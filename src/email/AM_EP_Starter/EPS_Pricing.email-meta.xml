[PACKAGES]

Important points to consider:

Last Will
1. Executor: The people you choose to collect and distribute your assets according to your will.  You can name one person to act alone or two people to work together.  Also, if you first choice can’t do it, you can name second and third choices.
2. Beneficiaries: People or charities you choose to receive your assets.  You can give specific items to people, like your car or a piece of jewelry.  You could also give a certain amount of money to a person or charity.  You also divide up the rest of your assets between the people or group that you choose – such as “all to my spouse” or “equally to my children.”
3. Trusts: If you would want to make sure a beneficiary doesn’t get his or her share of your assets until he reaches a certain age, you can state that a person’s share be held in a testamentary trust.  Some things to think about:
a. Who will manage the money in the trust – called a Trustee
