    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom for your business needs.

We’ve applied to the IRS for your Employer Identification Number (EIN), but have been unable to obtain the number without submitting proof of company formation. Please know that this is a common request from the IRS which we can easily resolve.

Attached is your completed SS-4 Form. Please have the listed officer sign and date where indicated at the bottom of the document and return the signed form to LegalZoom either:

By email to bzsupport@legalzoom.com
By fax at (323) 962-0227


Once we receive the signed SS-4 Form we will forward it to the IRS with a copy of your company’s filed articles. You should then expect to receive your EIN by mail, directly from the IRS, in approximately two weeks.

If you have questions about your EIN or have not received it within a few weeks of returning your signed SS-4 to LegalZoom, please contact the IRS directly by calling (800) 829-4933, Mon-Fri 7am to 7pm local time.

Please feel free to contact our Customer Care Team if we can be of further assistance.  Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at 1.800.773.0888. Our Customer Care Team is available Mon-Fri  5am to 7pm PT; Saturday  7am to 4pm PT.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
