    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry. After conducting a search of your proposed business name with the state of {!Contact.MailingState}, we learned that none of the name(s) you provided are available.

To continue processing your order, we will need an alternate business name to check again with the state. Please sign in to your account and click the link in the current status box at the top of the page to provide at least one new business name. There is no additional charge for this service.

Please feel free to contact our Customer Care Team if we can be of further assistance.  Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at 1.800.773.0888. Our Customer Care Team is available Mon-Fri  5am to 7pm PT; Saturday  7am to 4pm PT.
