    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business service needs.

On (manually enter date we tried to file form), LegalZoom attempted to obtain your Federal Tax ID Number (EIN) directly from the IRS via their online portal.  However, upon submission, the IRS requested we fax a copy of your Federal Tax ID Number (EIN) application to their office for further review, prior to issuance.  In order to do so, we first need your approval to fax your Federal Tax ID Number (EIN) application to the IRS office.  If you could please reply to this email with your approval and we will be happy to fax your Federal Tax ID Number (EIN) application to the IRS.

Please feel free to contact our Customer Care Team if we can be of further assistance.  Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at 1.800.773.0888. Our Customer Care Team is available Mon-Fri  5am to 7pm PT; Saturday  7am to 4pm PT.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
