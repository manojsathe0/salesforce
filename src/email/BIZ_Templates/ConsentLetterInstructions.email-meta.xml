    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry.

To proceed with your order using the entity name you selected, consent will be required from the conflicting entity that already exists.

This company’s listed contact info is:
[Company name]
[RA address]

When requesting consent to use your entity name, a few key steps are needed:

The entity providing consent must write out their consent on company letterhead.
The letter must give consent to the Customer (by name) to use their specific entity name, and provide consent to LegalZoom forming the company on the Customer’s behalf – sample attached
The name and address of the consenting company must be included in the letter.
The letter must be signed by an officer of the company (if a corporation), or a member or manager (if an LLC)

Once the consent is obtained, the letter can be returned to us via email, via fax, or by mail:

Email: bzsupport@legalzoom.com (include order number in subject line)
Fax: (323) 337-0743, Attn: Order # xxxxxxxx

Mail:
LegalZoom.com
Order #: xxxxxxxx
101 N Brand Blvd, 10th Floor

If you are unable to obtain consent or decide to try an alternate name instead, simply let us know.
