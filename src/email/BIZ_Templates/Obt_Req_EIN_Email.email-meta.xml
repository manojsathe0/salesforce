    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom for your business needs.

We will be requesting your Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS but need additional information from you to complete the application.

Please fill in the business activity in more detail on line 17.

Please also have the listed officer sign where indicated at the end of the form, and return the signed document to LegalZoom, either:

By email to bzsupport@legalzoom.com
By fax at (323) 962-0227


We will email the EIN to you as soon as we receive it from the IRS, typically within 3-5 business days of receiving your signed form.

Please feel free to contact our Customer Care Team if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at 1.800.773.0888. Our Customer Care Team is available Mon-Fri  5am to 7pm PT; Saturday  7am to 4pm PT.
