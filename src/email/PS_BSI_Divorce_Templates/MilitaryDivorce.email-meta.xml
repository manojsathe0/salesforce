    <textOnly>Dear Valued LegalZoom Customer,

Thank you for your recent inquiry.  In regards to your question, LegalZoom offers documents for uncontested divorces.  In an uncontested divorce, both spouses agree on all divorce terms and are willing and able to sign the necessary documents.  Uncontested divorces can be filed by either spouse and are usually filed in the county where either the husband or wife lives, regardless of where the marriage occurred.  If there are minor children involved, an uncontested divorce will generally be filed where those children live.  

At this time, we do not offer uncontested divorce documents for the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Tennessee, and Virginia.  In addition, we currently do not handle divorce documents for Iowa (if there are minor children involved), Missouri (St. Louis county), Minnesota (if there are minor children involved), and Pennsylvania (if there are minor children involved).

Generally, if one or both spouses are in the military, either person can file in the county where they live or where their spouse lives. In most cases, the spouse who didn?t file will not have to go to court ? he or she may just sign the documents. To find out the specific requirements in your area, you may contact your local county court. 

Some jurisdictions ? like Mississippi, Utah, Washington and Washington D.C - let active members of the military stationed there file for divorce as residents. Other jurisdictions have special provisions that let service people stationed overseas file for divorce without going to court. If you have additional questions about local requirements, please contact your command?s Judge Advocate General (JAG).

LegalZoom&apos;s fee for a divorce is $299.  This fee covers the proper completion of the divorce documents so that once you receive them, you are ready to have them served on your spouse (if necessary) and filed with your local court.  Please note that this fee does not cover any filing fees or fees associated with serving your spouse.  You may refer to your local court to inquire on information pertaining to filing fees and other third party fees.
