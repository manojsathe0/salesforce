    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in dissolving your business.  We simplify the process for you by preparing and filing the Articles of Dissolution with your respective Secretary of State.
 
For your reference, general information regarding Dissolutions has been outlined below.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.

Articles of Dissolution are typically required to notify the state that the entity is being dissolved and will no longer operate in that state.  The entity will typically need to be in good standing before the state will allow the entity to be dissolved, and must typically not owe the state any outstanding fees or taxes.
 
If your situation requires legal or tax advice, we offer our Business Advantage Pro (BAP) membership to provide you with access to licensed attorneys and tax professionals.  This service provides unlimited half-hour consultations on new legal and/or tax matters to help you ensure you are aware of all legal and tax implications of dissolving your business
