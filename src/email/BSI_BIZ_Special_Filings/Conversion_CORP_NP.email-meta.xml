    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in converting your existing Corporation into a Non-Profit Corporation.  We simplify the process for you by preparing and filing the Articles of Conversion with your respective Secretary of State.  LegalZoom can also assist you in preparing your 501(c) Application for your existing Non-Profit Corporation so that you can apply for tax exempt status.  We simplify this process for you by preparing the entire 501(c) Application, and providing specific instructions on the submission process to the IRS.
 
For your reference, general information regarding Conversions has been outlined below.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.

A Conversion allows an existing entity to be converted directly into another structure, allowing the entity to keep all of its existing records, financial data, and business history throughout the change of business structure.  This process also typically requires that the business’ internal documents be converted to the appropriate documents for the new structure.  
 
One of the biggest advantages of a Non-Profit Corporation is the ability to apply for tax exempt status from the IRS and state government.  This tax exempt status allows the Non-Profit to be exempt from income taxes on any funds coming into the business, and also allows the donors to the organization to deduct their contributions on their individual tax returns.  Tax exempt status with the IRS is obtained by applying for a 501(c) designation from the IRS.  We offer preparation services for this application, in which we will fill out the application for your Non-Profit and ensure that it is filled out properly, based on the information you provide about your Non-Profit.
 
Our 501(c) Application preparation service makes the process easy for you to apply for tax exemption for your Non-Profit Corporation.  We prepare the entire Application and provide you step-by-step instructions on what needs to be submitted to the IRS with the Application.  The IRS has a processing fee that will be paid at the time the Application is submitted, and this fee will depend on the projected income of the Non-Profit.  If the projected average annual income for the first four years of the Non-Profit’s existence is $10,000 or less, the IRS filing fee is $400; otherwise it is $850.  

Please keep in mind that you may need to contact the IRS to inform them of the change in structure, and fulfill any additional provisions they require.
