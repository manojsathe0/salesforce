Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in Foreign Qualifying your business into another state.  We simplify the process for you by preparing and filing the necessary documents with your respective Secretary of State.
 
For your reference, general information regarding Foreign Qualification has been outlined below.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.

Foreign Qualification is the process in which the existing entity is registered to conduct business in a state outside of the state in which it was formed.  This process allows the existing business to use all of its existing financial data and business history for conducting business in the state into which it qualifies.  Foreign entities will be required to fulfill any state or local requirements or licenses in the new state, as well as file annual reports and pay any required state fees.
