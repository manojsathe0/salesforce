    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in converting your existing Corporation into a Limited Liability Company (LLC).  We simplify the process for you by preparing and filing the Articles of Conversion with your respective Secretary of State, and by drafting a customized, state-specific Operating Agreement for the business.
 
For your reference, general information regarding Conversions has been outlined below.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.

A Conversion allows an existing entity to be converted directly into another structure, allowing the entity to keep all of its existing records, financial data, and business history throughout the change of business structure.  This process also typically requires that the business’ internal documents be converted to the appropriate documents for the new structure.  
 
Please keep in mind that you may need to contact the IRS to inform them of the change in structure, and fulfill any additional provisions they require.
 
For your convenience, we have listed all relevant pricing below.
