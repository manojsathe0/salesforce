    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, while LegalZoom does not currently directly assist with Seller&apos;s Permits in your situation, we do offer a Business License Compliance Package which will assist you in determining any required license or permit for your specific business, including a Seller&apos;s Permit.  

This service is offered in two packages, the first of which is our Basic Compliance Report.  This Report will provide you with blank copies of the applications necessary to obtain these permits or licenses.  The second package is the Preparation package, which will assist you by completing all of the applications on your behalf, and supplying you with detailed instructions on how to submit the applications to the appropriate authority.
 
For your convenience, we have listed all relevant pricing below.
