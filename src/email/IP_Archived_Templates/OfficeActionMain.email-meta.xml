    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom.

Office Actions are direct correspondences from the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and are generally either requesting additional information or updating you on the status of your application (or both). If you wish to view and/or download a copy of your Office Action, please visit http://tmportal.uspto.gov/external/portal/tow.

Based on the Office Action received, it appears that your Examining Attorney at the USPTO has some additional questions: 

****INSERT OFFICE ACTION ISSUES****

You may contact your Examining Attorney, XXXX, directly at XXX-XXX-XXXX to discuss the issues raised in your Office Action.  Some issues can be resolved through an Examiner&apos;s Amendment, which can sometimes be completed simply by calling the Examining Attorney directly.  Additional instructions can be found at the bottom of your Office Action.

Please feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance.  Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}.  Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
