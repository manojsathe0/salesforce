    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom.

Office Actions are direct correspondences from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and are generally either requesting additional information or updating you on the status of your application (or both). If you wish to view and/or download your Office Action, please visit here

Based on your Office Action, it appears your proposed Trademark—(INDICATE MARK) for (INDICATE G&amp;S)—is being rejected because the Examining Attorney believes that it merely describes a purpose or function of your goods and/or services. A Trademark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose or use of the specified goods and/or services. (INDICATE EXAMINER’S CONCERN-SEE OFFICE ACTION).

Based on the Office Action received, it also appears that your Examining Attorney at the USPTO has some additional questions:

****INSERT OFFICE ACTION ISSUES****

Although the Examining Attorney has refused registration, you may respond to the refusal to register by submitting evidence and arguments in support of the registration. You may also choose to appeal a final refusal.

Otherwise, you may contact the USPTO Assistance Center at 800-786-9199 or call your Examining Attorney: XXXXXX at XXX-XXX-XXXX. Additional instructions can be found at the bottom of your Office Action.
