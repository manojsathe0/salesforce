If you wish to view and/or download your Office Action, please visit <a href=http://tmportal.uspto.gov/external/portal/tow>here</a>.<br/><br/>Based on your Office Action, it appears your proposed Trademark is being rejected because the Examining Attorney believes that the Trademark, as used on the specimen of record, is merely a decorative or ornamental feature of the goods; it does not function as a Trademark to identify and distinguish the applicant&#8217;s goods from those of others and to indicate the source of the applicant&#8217;s goods.<br/><br/>In response to such an Office Action, an applicant may submit a substitute specimen that shows proper Trademark use. Examples of such specimens are tags, labels and containers that show the mark on packaging or displays associated with the goods at their point of sale. For services, appropriate specimens can be advertisements or webpages that feature the proposed Trademark prominently. If you choose to pursue this option, please reply to this email and attach an image of your new specimen, preferably in .gif, .pdf, .jpeg or .jpg format. LegalZoom will then assist you with filing your response.<br/><br/>Based on the Office Action received, it also appears that your Examining Attorney at the USPTO has some additional questions: <br/><br/>****INSERT OFFICE ACTION ISSUES****<br/><br/>You may contact the USPTO Assistance Center at 800-786-9199 or call your Examining Attorney: XXXXXX at XXX-XXX-XXXX. Additional instructions can be found at the bottom of your Office Action.<br/><br/>Please reply to this email and let us know how you would like to proceed. <br/><br/>Feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.<br/><br/>Thank you again for using LegalZoom.<br/><br/>Best regards,<br/><br/>The LegalZoom Team<br/>___________________________________<br/><br/>{!snippetVariable.tmoa_bap}<br/> </p></div>
