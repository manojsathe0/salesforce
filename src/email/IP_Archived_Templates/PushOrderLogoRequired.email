Otherwise, you can upload your image directly by visiting the &#34;Ask A Question&#34; section of LegalZoom&#39;s website: {!snippetVariable.aaq_link_only}<br/>***MAC USERS: upload your image directly by visiting the &#34;Ask A Question&#34; section of LegalZoom&#39;s website: {!snippetVariable.aaq_link_only}***<br/><br/>IMPORTANT NOTE: If you would like to address this issue or place your order on hold, please reply to this email or send an email directly to trademarks@legalzoom.com as soon as possible. If a response is not received within 10 days of this email, LegalZoom will file your trademark application on your behalf to reflect:<br/>Mark Format: Typed (words and/or standard characters only)<br/><br/>Trademark applications submitted in a typed format are filed solely to protect the mark&#8217;s wording, without claim to any designs or artwork. Marks filed in a typed format can be used and altered at the applicant&#8217;s discretion, so long as the words (the &#8220;literal element&#8221;) remain the same (and the alterations do not result in a mark that is likely to be confused with another entity&#8217;s mark). In other words, the applicant may use the mark in any font style or color, and maintain trademark protection. Under a typed format, a copy of the logo is not needed.<br/><br/>No changes can be made to the application once the trademark application has been filed.<br/><br/>Feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}.
