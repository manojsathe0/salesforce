    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom.

Office Actions are direct correspondences from the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and are generally either requesting additional information or updating you on the status of your application (or both). If you wish to view and/or download a copy of your Office Action, please visit here.

Based on your Office Action, it appears your proposed Trademark is being rejected due to a likelihood of confusion with Trademark Registration No. XXXXXX (US serial number XXXXXXX) [add additional if necessary]. As part of LegalZoom&apos;s services, we provide a preliminary direct hit search for potential conflicts. Although the referenced Trademark(s) was included in your search results and sent to you on DD/MM/YYYY, you decided to go forward with the application process. Your search conflict email is re-attached here for your convenience.

Based on the Office Action received, it also appears that your Examining Attorney at the USPTO has some additional questions:

****INSERT OFFICE ACTION ISSUES****

Although the Examining Attorney has refused your application for registration, you may respond to the refusal to register by submitting evidence and arguments in support of your application. You may also choose to appeal a final refusal.

Otherwise, you may contact the USPTO Assistance Center at 800-786-9199 or call your Examining Attorney: XXXXXX at XXX-XXX-XXXX. Additional instructions can be found at the bottom of your Office Action.

Please feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.

Thank you again for using LegalZoom.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
