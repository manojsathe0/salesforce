    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom.

Office Actions are direct correspondences from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and are generally either requesting additional information or updating you on the status of your application (or both). If you wish to view and/or download your Office Action, please visit here.

Based on your Office Action, it appears your proposed Trademark is being rejected because the Examining Attorney believes that the Trademark, as used on the specimen of record, is merely a decorative or ornamental feature of the goods; it does not function as a Trademark to identify and distinguish the applicant’s goods from those of others and to indicate the source of the applicant’s goods.

In response to such an Office Action, an applicant may submit a substitute specimen that shows proper Trademark use. Examples of such specimens are tags, labels and containers that show the mark on packaging or displays associated with the goods at their point of sale. For services, appropriate specimens can be advertisements or webpages that feature the proposed Trademark prominently. If you choose to pursue this option, please reply to this email and attach an image of your new specimen, preferably in .gif, .pdf, .jpeg or .jpg format. LegalZoom will then assist you with filing your response.

Based on the Office Action received, it also appears that your Examining Attorney at the USPTO has some additional questions:

You may contact the USPTO Assistance Center at 800-786-9199 or call your Examining Attorney: XXXXXX at XXX-XXX-XXXX. Additional instructions can be found at the bottom of your Office Action.
