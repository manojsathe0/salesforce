We have conducted a Federal Direct-Hit Search of your proposed logo, and have attached a report with your results to this email. This report includes information about trademarks both registered and pending with the US Patent and Trademark Office (also called the USPTO) that may conflict with your mark.<br/><br/>

<b>What is a conflict?</b><br/><br/>

In its review of your trademark application, the USPTO will search federal records for conflicts between your proposed mark and any other registered or pending mark. In general, the USPTO will reject an application if it finds that there would be a &#8220;likelihood of consumer confusion&#8221; between your mark and another mark. Marks, goods, and/or services do not have to be identical for the USPTO to come to this conclusion. A number of factors are considered by the USPTO to determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists, including:<ul><li>The similarity of the marks in appearance<br/><li> Whether the marks are used to sell similar kinds of goods or services.<br/><li>The number of similar marks currently in use.<br/><li>The similarity of established sales channels and the sophistication of the buyers.<br/></ul>

For more information about the &#8220;likelihood of confusion,&#8221; click here:<br/>{!snippetVariable.tm_search_conflict_link} <br/><br/>

If you have any questions or would like additional information, simply reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT.<br/><br/>

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to serving you again soon.<br/><br/>

Best regards,<br/><p>

The LegalZoom Team
