The Office Action you received is called a Suspension Letter. Suspension Letters suspend the action on an application. If you wish to view and/or download your Office Action, please visit <a href=http://tmportal.uspto.gov/external/portal/tow>here</a>.<br/><br/>Based on your Suspension Letter, it appears your Examining Attorney has suspended action on your Trademark application pending the disposition of Application Serial No(s) XXXX.<br/><br/>Since your effective filing date is after the effective filing date of Application Serial No(s) XXXX, this/these application(s) may be cited against your application and may result in the USPTO refusing to register your proposed Trademark.<br/><br/>You may submit a request to remove your application from suspension to present arguments related to the potential conflict posed by the relevant application(s) or other arguments related to the ground for suspension stated in your Suspension Letter. If you choose not to present arguments during suspension, it will not affect your right to present arguments later should the USPTO in fact refuse to register your proposed Trademark. If a refusal does issue, you will have six (6) months from the mailing or e-mailing date of the Office Action containing that refusal to submit any response you wish.<br/><br/>****(PLEASE ADD THE FOLLOWING, IF APPLICABLE) As part of LegalZoom&#39;s services, we provide a preliminary search for potential conflicts. Although these marks were sent to your attention on XX/XX/XXXX, you decided to complete the application process. Your search conflict email is re-attached here for your convenience.*****<br/><br/>Otherwise, you may contact the USPTO Assistance Center at 800-786-9199 or call your Examining Attorney: XXXXXX at XXX-XXX-XXXX. Additional instructions can be found at the bottom of your Office Action.<br/><br/>Please feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.<br/><br/>Thank you again for using LegalZoom.<br/><br/>Best regards,<br/><br/>The LegalZoom Team<br/>___________________________________<br/><br/>{!snippetVariable.tmoa_bap}<br/></p></div>
