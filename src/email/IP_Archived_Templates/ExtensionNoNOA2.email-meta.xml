    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 
 
Thank you for using LegalZoom.
 
During the initial submission of your order, it was brought to your attention that the status of your trademark was still pending with the US Patent and Trademark Office. Because you had not been issued a Notice of Allowance, we were unable to process your Statement of Use Extension request at the time.
 
This is a courtesy reminder to check the current status of your application at http://tarr.uspto.gov/. If you have received your Notice of Allowance at this point, please contact us to continue with the filing of your Statement of Use Extension Request. 
 
Refunds must be requested within 60 days of purchase. If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please contact us. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at 1-800-773-0888.  
 
Best Regards,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName} 
{!User.Title} 
{!User.CompanyName}
