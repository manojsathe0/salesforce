If you wish to view and/or download your Office Action, please visit <a href=http://tmportal.uspto.gov/external/portal/tow>here</a>.<br/><br/>Based on your Office Action, it appears your proposed Trademark is being rejected due to a likelihood of confusion with Trademark Registration No. XXXXXX (US serial number XXXXXXX) [add additional if necessary]. Currently, you have the following options:<br/><br/>1. Receive a refund of $XXX.XX.; or<br/>2. Submit a new mark for submission at no additional cost to you.; or<br/>3.
