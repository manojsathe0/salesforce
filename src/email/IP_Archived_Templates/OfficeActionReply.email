If you wish to view and/or download your Office Action, please visit <a href=http://tmportal.uspto.gov/external/portal/tow>here</a>.  Based on the Office Action received, it appears that your Examining Attorney at the USPTO has the following questions: <br/><br/>****INSERT OFFICE ACTION ISSUES****<br/><br/>LegalZoom can assist you with preparing your Response to Office Action. Please address the following: <br/>******************For logos*****************<br/><br/>Please reply to this email and attach a clear drawing of your logo, preferably in .jpg, .jpeg, .gif or .pdf format.<br/><br/>******************For color logos*****************<br/><br/>Please reply to this email and attach a clear drawing of your color logo and provide the following information:<br/><br/>(1) A color claim naming the colors that are a feature of the mark; and (2) a separate statement describing where the color(s) appear on the mark. A color drawing will not publish without both of these statements. <br/><br/>A properly worded color claim would read as follows:<br/>The color(s) &#60;name the color(s)&#62; are claimed as a distinctive feature of the mark.<br/><br/>A properly worded description would read as follows:<br/>The color(s) &#60;name the color(s)&#62; appear in &#60;specify portion of mark on which color(s) appear&#62;.<br/><br/>If the color claim or description is unclear or ambiguous, the examining attorney must require clarification. <br/><br/>******************For specimens************<br/><br/>Please reply to this email and attach an image of your specimen, preferably in .gif, .pdf, .jpeg or .jpg format. A specimen is a real world example of how your mark is currently being used in commerce, and is more than just a picture of your Trademark or logo.

If submitting a business card as your specimen, that business card must state clearly the service provided, as well as including the Trademark. ***Please note that stationery is generally not acceptable as a specimen for services.***<br/><br/>For goods, acceptable specimens include labels or tags attached to the product, packaging material, instruction manuals and containers which display the Trademark. ***Please note that websites, advertisements, brochures, business cards, catalogs and stationery are generally not acceptable specimens for goods.***<br/><br/>Otherwise, you may contact the USPTO Assistance Center at 800-786-9199 or call your Examining Attorney: XXXXXX at XXX-XXX-XXXX.
