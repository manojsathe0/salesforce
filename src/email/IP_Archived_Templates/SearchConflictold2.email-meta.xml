    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
 
Thank you for using LegalZoom.
 
We have conducted a preliminary search of the Federal Trademark Register. Please review the attached trademark(s) for potential conflicts and let us know if you wish to continue filing your application. 

What is a conflict?  

As part of the application process, the examining attorney will search records with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to see if a conflict exists between the mark in your application and another registered or pending mark. In general, the Trademark Office will reject an application if there is a &quot;likelihood of consumer confusion&quot;. To find a conflict, the marks do not have to be identical, and the goods and/or services do not have to be the exactly the same. Some factors include:
 
? The similarity of the marks in appearance, sound and meaning.
? The relatedness of the goods or service.
? The number of similar marks currently in use.
? The similarity of established sales channels and the sophistication of the buyers.
 
For more information regarding likelihood of confusion:
