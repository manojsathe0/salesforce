Please review the attached trademark(s) for potential conflicts and let us know if you wish to continue filing your application.<br/><br/>What is a conflict?<br/><br/>As part of the application process, the examining attorney will search records with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to see if a conflict exists between the mark in your application and another registered or pending mark. In general, the Trademark Office will reject an application if there is a &#34;likelihood of consumer confusion&#34;. To find a conflict, the marks do not have to be identical, and the goods and/or services do not have to be the exactly the same. Some factors include:<br/> <br/>&#8226; The similarity of the marks in appearance, sound and meaning.<br/>&#8226; The relatedness of the goods or service.<br/>&#8226; The number of similar marks currently in use.<br/>&#8226; The similarity of established sales channels and the sophistication of the buyers.<br/> <br/>For more information regarding likelihood of confusion:<br/>{!snippetVariable.tm_search_conflict_link}<br/> <br/>Next Steps<br/>After reviewing these marks, please reply to this e-mail and let me know how you would like to proceed:<br/> <br/>1. Process your original Trademark application as is<br/>2. Submit a new name or logo to receive a FREE updated direct-hit search (up to 3 searches are included with your Trademark application order)<br/>3.
