    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

As a reminder, we are still waiting for some materials from you in order to complete your trademark Statement of Use order. The deadline to complete your Statement to Use is [Enter Date Here]. If you miss this deadline, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) will deem your trademark application abandoned. No refunds will be possible.

To complete your trademark registration, the USPTO requires that you submit a Statement of Use, along with proof (called a “specimen”) that you are using your trademark in connection with the sales of the goods and services listed in your application. The specimen you provide should be an actual example that clearly shows how the trademark is being used. 

----------------------------------
SUBMITTING YOUR MATERIALS:

Please reply to this e-mail and attach your materials, preferably in .jpg, .jpeg, .gif or .pdf format. Email attachments cannot exceed 6MB.

If you are using a Mac computer or your attachments are larger than 6MB combined, please upload your image(s) directly at http://legalzoom.force.com/LZWTC. 

Or, if you prefer, you can mail us your materials.  Our mailing address is:

{!snippet.Variable.ip_address_tm_materials}

Please note: LegalZoom will not share your materials with any third party unless necessary for the completion of your order.  Furthermore, LegalZoom does not retain physical copies of your submissions, and will not be held responsible for returning those materials to you.
