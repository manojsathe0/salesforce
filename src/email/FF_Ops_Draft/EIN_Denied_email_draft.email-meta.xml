    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom for your business needs.

We&apos;ve applied to the IRS for your Employer Identification Number (EIN), but have been unable to obtain the number without submitting proof of the company formation. Please know that this is a common request from the IRS which we can reasily resolve.

Attached is your completed SS-4 Form. Please have the listed officer sign and date where indicated at the bottom of the document and return the signed form to Legalzoom either:

By email to bzsupport@legalzoom.com
By fax at (323) 962-0227


Once we receive the signed SS-4 Form we will forward it to the IRS with a copy of your company&apos;s filed articles. You should then expect to receive your EIN by mail, directly from the IRS, in approximately two weeks.

If you have questions about your EIN or have not received it within a few weeks of returning your signed SS-4 to LegalZoom, please contact the IRS directly by calling (800) 829-4933, Mon-Fri 7am to 7pm local time.

If you have questions about your order, you may contact our Customer Care representatives by replying to this email or calling us at (800) 773-0888 Mon-Fri, 7am to 9pm, Central Time.

Thank you again for choosing LegalZoom.
