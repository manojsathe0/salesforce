    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in forming your Corporation or Limited Liability Company (LLC).  We simplify the process for you by preparing and filing the Articles of Formation with your respective Secretary of State, and by drafting customized, state-specific internal documents for your business.

To help you make an informed decision, provided below is a comparison of Corporations and LLCs and some of the similarities and differences between them.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.
 
Corporations and LLCs are state-specific business entities that provide several advantages as a business structure.  Corporations and LLCs are separate and distinct legal entities that provide the people involved in the business with personal liability protection, separating personal assets from business assets.  This liability protection shields personal assets from any debts or liabilities that are incurred by the business.  Corporations and LLCs also provide name exclusivity in the state in which it is registered, ensuring that other Corporations and LLCs cannot use the same business name in the state.
 
Corporations require more formalities than an LLC.  Corporations are required to designate directors, officers, and shareholders, although one person can hold all necessary positions.  Corporations also require to that annual shareholder and director meetings be held and written minutes of these meetings must be kept on company records.  LLCs do not necessarily have these requirements.

LLCs also provide some tax flexibility.  You may choose to be taxed as a pass-through entity (such as a sole proprietorship or partnership), as a C-Corporation, or as an  S-Corporation.  Pass-through entities typically report business income and expenses with the owner&apos;s personal tax return(s), while Corporations file a separate corporate tax return.  C-Corporations are subject to double taxation, meaning that profits are taxed at the corporate level, and possibly taxed a second time at the individual level.  S-Corporations are subject to single-taxation, and are taxed similarly to pass-through entities, while potentially providing more tax benefits than a pass-through entity.  For further information on tax structure, please consult an accountant or CPA.
 
The link below gives a detailed comparison between these business structures to assist you in determining the best structure to suit your needs.
