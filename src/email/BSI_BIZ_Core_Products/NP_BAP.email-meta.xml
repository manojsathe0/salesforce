    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in forming your Non-Profit Corporation.  We simplify the process for you by preparing and filing the Articles of Incorporation with your respective Secretary of State., and by providing templates for drafting the Bylaws &amp; Resolutions for the entity.
 
For your reference, general information regarding establishing a Non-Profit Corporation has been outlined below, including information regarding applying for tax-exempt status for the entity.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.

Non-Profit Corporations offer several distinct advantages as a business structure.  One of these advantages is name protection within the state of formation, guaranteeing name exclusivity in that state.  Another advantage is the personal liability protection provided to the people involved.  Since the corporation is a separate and distinct legal entity, the assets of the people involved are shielded from any debts, liabilities, or lawsuit settlements that the business may incur.  
 
One of the biggest advantages of a Non-Profit Corporation is the ability to apply for tax exempt status from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and state government.  This tax exempt status allows the Non-Profit to be exempt from income taxes on any funds coming into the business, and also allows the donors to the organization to deduct their contributions on their individual tax returns.  Tax exempt status with the IRS is obtained by applying for a 501(c) designation from the IRS.  We offer preparation services for this application, in which we will fill out the application for your Non-Profit based on the information you provide in our online questionnaires, ensuring the application is filled out properly.
 
Our 501(c) Application preparation service makes the process easy for you to apply for tax exemption for your Non-Profit Corporation.  We prepare the entire Application and provide you step-by-step instructions on what needs to be submitted to the IRS with the Application.  The IRS has a processing fee that will be paid at the time the Application is submitted, and this fee will depend on the projected income of the Non-Profit.  If the projected average annual income for the first four years of the Non-Profit’s existence is $10,000 or less, the IRS filing fee is $400; otherwise it is $850.  
 
For specific legal or tax advice, we offer our Business Advantage Pro (BAP) membership to provide you with access to licensed attorneys and tax professionals.  This service provides unlimited half-hour consultations on new legal and/or tax matters with licensed attorneys and tax professionals to help you ensure you are making the best choice from a legal and/or tax perspective.  In addition, this membership provides unlimited access to our Legal Forms database, which includes over 100 legal business forms, and one free Copyright registration per month (excluding US Copyright Office filing fees).

For your convenience, we have listed below all relevant pricing, as well as some additional services that may be beneficial to your business.
