    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in forming your Limited Partnership (LP).  We simplify the process for you by preparing and filing the Certificate of Partnership with your respective Secretary of State.
 
For your reference, general information regarding establishing an LP has been outlined below.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.

An LP is a state-specific business entity that provides several advantages as a business structure.  LPs consist of two types of partners:  general partners and limited partners.  LPs are attractive for business owners since they can operate as the general partner(s), receiving capital contributions from the limited partner(s), while still maintaining full control of the business; however the general partner(s) is/are fully liable in the event of business loss or lawsuit settlement.  LPs are attractive to investors since they can be involved as the limited partner(s) in the business, investing capital into the business, but being free from the responsibilities of managing of the business.  The limited partners are protected with limited liability protection, and their assets are shielded from any debts or liabilities that are incurred by the business.  An LP also provides name exclusivity in the state where it is registered, ensuring that other LPs cannot use the same business name in the state.  Once an LP is established, it is able to conduct business, open a bank account, hire employees, and own property.
