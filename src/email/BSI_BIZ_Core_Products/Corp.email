  <td style="padding:15px 15px 15px 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:11.5px; line-height:17px; border:1px solid #CCCCCC;">Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},<br/><br/>
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in forming your Corporation.  We simplify the process for you by preparing and filing the Articles of Incorporation with your respective Secretary of State, and by drafting customized, state-specific Bylaws & Resolutions for your business.<br/><br/>
 
For your reference, general information regarding establishing a Corporation has been outlined below.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.<br/><br/>
 
A Corporation is a state-specific business entity that provides several advantages as a business structure.  Corporations are separate and distinct legal entities that provide the people involved in the business with personal liability protection, separating personal assets from business assets.  This liability protection shields personal assets from any debts or liabilities that are incurred by the business.  A Corporation also provides name exclusivity in the state where it is registered, ensuring that other Corporations cannot use the same business name in the state.  Once a Corporation is established, it is able to conduct business, open a bank account, hire employees, and own property.<br/><br/>
 
For your convenience, we have listed below all relevant pricing, as well as some additional services that may be beneficial to your business.<br/><br/>
