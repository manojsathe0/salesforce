    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in forming your Limited Liability Company (LLC).  We simplify the process for you by preparing and filing the Articles of Organization with your respective Secretary of State, and by drafting a customized, state-specific Operating Agreement for your business.

For your reference, general information regarding establishing an LLC has been outlined below.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.

LLCs are state-specific entities, meaning that its ability to conduct business is typically limited to the state in which it is filed.  This could include the Corporation&apos;s ability to hire employees, obtain licenses and permits, and have liability protection.  For this reason most of our customers choose to file their Corporation in the state where they will be conducting the majority of their business.
 
For specific legal or tax advice, we offer our Business Advantage Pro (BAP) membership to provide you with access to licensed attorneys and tax professionals.  This service provides unlimited half-hour consultations on new legal and/or tax matters with licensed attorneys and tax professionals to help you ensure you are making the best choice from a legal and/or tax perspective.  In addition, this membership provides unlimited access to our Legal Forms database, which includes over 100 legal business forms, and one free Copyright registration per month (excluding US Copyright Office filing fees).
