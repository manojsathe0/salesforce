    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in changing the Registered Agent for your business.  In order to begin this process, you will need to provide the name and address of the party you wish to designate as the new Registered Agent.
 
Please keep in mind that this party must be an adult with a physical address in the state of formation; PO Boxes are not permitted.  The agent must be available at that address during standard business hours to accept any documentation.  The name and address of this Agent become public record which typically results in reduced privacy and increased junk mail.
 
For your convenience, we have listed the relevant pricing below.
 
REGISTERED AGENT CHANGE
Rush - $55.00 + state fee - (7-10 business days)*
Standard - $35.00 + state fee + shipping - (20-35 business days)

To determine the state fee for your state, please contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.
