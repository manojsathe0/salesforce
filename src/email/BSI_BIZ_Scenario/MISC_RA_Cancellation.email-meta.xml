    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in cancelling your Registered Agent service.  In order to cancel the Registered Agent service, a new Registered Agent must be appointed or the entity must be dissolved.  

For your reference, general information regarding the Registered Agent and the options available to you has been outlined below.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.

If the entity will continue operating, we can assist you changing the Registered Agent for your business.  In order to begin this process, you will need to provide the name and address of the party you wish to designate as the new Registered Agent.  Please keep in mind that this party must be an adult with a physical address in the state of formation; PO Boxes are not permitted.  The agent must be available at that address during standard business hours to accept any documentation.  The name and address of this Agent become public record which typically results in reduced privacy and increased junk mail.

If the entity will no longer be in operation, we can assist you in dissolving the entity, thus eliminating the necessity of maintaining a Registered Agent.  Articles of Dissolution are typically required to notify the state that the entity is being dissolved and will no longer operate in that state.  The entity will typically need to be in good standing before the state will allow the entity to be dissolved, and must typically not owe the state any outstanding fees or taxes.

Whichever route you choose, once the Registered Agent service is cancelled, we can issue a prorated refund of the unused portion of your current Registered Agent subscription.
