    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in expediting the filing process for your entity.  The expedited processing reduces the package turnaround time from approximately 20-35 business days to 7-10 business days.  Your final package will be sent out to you within 7-10 business days from when you expedite the order.

In some instances, it may be more cost effective to upgrade to the Express Gold package instead of adding the expedited processing.  In order to determine the most cost effective method, or to add the expedited processing, you will need to contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.
 
EXPEDITE SERVICE - $115.00 + state fee - (7-10 business days)*

To determine the state fee for your state, please contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.
 
* Some states may have delays which affect the listed turnaround time.  To determine if your state is affected, please contact a Specialist at the phone number listed below.

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom with your business inquiries, and we look forward to assisting you.  If you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact us by phone at the phone number listed below.
