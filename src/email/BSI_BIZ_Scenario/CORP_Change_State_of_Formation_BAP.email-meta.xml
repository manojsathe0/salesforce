    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in moving your business to a new state.  We simplify the process for you by preparing and filing the Articles of Dissolution with your respective Secretary of State, and by preparing and filing the Articles of Incorporation with the new Secretary of State, and by drafting customized, state-specific Bylaws &amp; Resolutions for your business.

For your reference, general information regarding dissolving an existing Corporation and filing a new Corporation has been outlined below.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.
 
Because Corporations are state-specific entities, it is typically not possible to directly move a Corporation from one state to another.  The process of relocating an entity to a new state is typically accomplished by dissolving the entity in the current state, and filing a new entity in the new state.  This change may require the entity to obtain a new Employer Identification Number (EIN), however you may contact the IRS directly to inquire about the possibility of keeping the existing EIN.

For specific legal or tax advice, we offer our Business Advantage Pro (BAP) membership to provide you with access to licensed attorneys and tax professionals.  This service provides unlimited half-hour consultations on new legal and/or tax matters with licensed attorneys and tax professionals to help you ensure you are making the best choice from a legal and/or tax perspective.  In addition, this membership provides unlimited access to our Legal Forms database, which includes over 100 legal business forms, and one free Copyright registration per month (excluding US Copyright Office filing fees).

For your convenience, we have listed below all relevant pricing, as well as some additional services that may be beneficial to your business.
