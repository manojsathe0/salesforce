    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in moving your organization to a new state.  We simplify the process for you by preparing and filing the Articles of Dissolution with your respective Secretary of State, and by preparing and filing the Articles of Incorporation with the new Secretary of State, and by providing templates for drafting the Bylaws &amp; Resolutions for the entity.

For your reference, general information regarding dissolving an existing Non-Profit Corporation and filing a new Non-Profit Corporation has been outlined below.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.
 
Because Non-Profit Corporations are state-specific entities, it is typically not possible to directly move a Non-Profit Corporation from one state to another.  The process of relocating an entity to a new state is typically accomplished by dissolving the entity in the current state, and filing a new entity in the new state.  This change may require the entity to obtain a new Employer Identification Number (EIN), however you may contact the IRS directly to inquire about the possibility of keeping the existing EIN.  You may also wish to contact the IRS to determine what effect this process will have on the tax exempt status of the entity.

For your convenience, we have listed below all relevant pricing, as well as some additional services that may be beneficial to your business.
