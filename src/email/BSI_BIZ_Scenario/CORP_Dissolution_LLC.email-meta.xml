    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in changing your current business structure from a Corporation into a Limited Liability Company (LLC).  We simplify the process for you by preparing and filing the Articles of Dissolution with your respective Secretary of State, and by preparing and filing the Articles of Organization with your respective Secretary of State, and by drafting a customized, state-specific Operating Agreement for your business.
 
For your reference, general information regarding dissolving an existing Corporation and filing a new LLC has been outlined below.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.

Many states do not offer a direct conversion process to convert from a Corporation to an LLC.  In these circumstances, the process typically involves dissolving the existing Corporation and filing a new LLC in its place.  This change may require the entity to obtain a new Employer Identification Number (EIN), however you may contact the IRS directly to inquire about the possibility of keeping the existing EIN.

For your convenience, we have listed below all relevant pricing, as well as some additional services that may be beneficial to your business.
