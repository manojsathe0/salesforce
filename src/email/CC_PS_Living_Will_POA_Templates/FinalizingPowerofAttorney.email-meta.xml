    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry.

Here are the instructions for finalizing your Power of Attorney:

1. You and your attorney-in-fact will need to sign all signature lines in the presence of two (or three, depending on the state) witnesses.

2. Your witnesses will also have to sign the document(s). Do not use the following persons as witnesses: 

*   Any person you appointed as attorney-in-fact or alternate
*   The spouse or children of your attorney-in-fact or alternate
*   Any person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption
*   Any person entitled to receive anything under any last will and testament that you have made

3. The Power of Attorney should be notarized by a notary public.
