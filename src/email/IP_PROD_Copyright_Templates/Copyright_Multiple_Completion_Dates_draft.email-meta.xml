    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

You indicated on your application multiple completion dates for the work you are seeking to register. However, the U.S. Copyright Office allows only one completion date to be listed for a work: the year that work was completed.

In order to proceed with your application, we need to know the year your work was completed. Please reply to this email as soon as possible with the single correct year.

If you have any questions or would like additional information, simply reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
