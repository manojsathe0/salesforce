    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for contacting us about the status of your Copyright registration.

The time it takes the U.S. Copyright Office to process your Copyright filing varies, based on the office’s workload and backlog. LegalZoom is not able to expedite or influence the Copyright Office’s processing of your application. In general, processing times for electronic filing average around 3 months.

NOTE: Despite variable and sometimes lengthy processing times, the effective date for registration of your work is the day that all the required elements (in acceptable form) are received by the U.S. Copyright Office.

If the Copyright Office has any questions about your application, a representative from that office will contact you directly by email or letter.

If you have any questions or would like additional information, simply reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to serving you again soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
