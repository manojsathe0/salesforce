    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

While reviewing your Copyright application, we noticed a potential issue that may delay your registration application with the US Copyright Office.

We need to confirm whether the work received was “made for hire.” A work made for hire is:

1) A work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment, or
2) A work that is specially ordered or commissioned in specified circumstances. In such cases, the employer or the person who commissioned the work is considered the author and owner of the work.

To process your Copyright application without further delay, please call me at the number and extension below at your earliest convenience.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

{!User.Name}, {!User.Title}
{!User.CompanyName}
{!User.Street}, {!User.City}, {!User.State} {!User.PostalCode}
