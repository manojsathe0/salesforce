    <subject>Order on Hold: Copyright Application Title Inconsistency</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

There appears to be a problem with your order. Your application will not be filed with the U.S. Copyright Office until this problem is resolved, so please respond to this email as soon as possible.

Specifically, in the questionnaire, you indicated that “Title from Questionnaire” is the title of the work. However, the title identified on the copy of the work that you submitted reads “Title from Deposit Material.”

To resolve this problem, please reply to this email and select ONE of the following options:

1.  Submit a new copy of the work that matches the title specified in the questionnaire.

2.  Revise the title identified in the questionnaire to match the title identified on the copy of the work that you submitted. (If you select this option, please also confirm the title that you would like listed in the application.)

3. Have us submit the application with the information that you previously provided. During examination of the application, if the copyright examiner raises questions regarding this matter, you will be responsible for responding to the request with the appropriate information.

If you have any questions or would like additional information, you can reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT.

We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
