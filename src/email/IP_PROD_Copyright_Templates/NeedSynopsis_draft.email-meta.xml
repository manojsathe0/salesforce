    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your Federal Copyright Registration through LegalZoom.

During review of your file, we noticed an issue that may delay the registration of your work.

For motion picture works, the Copyright Office requires that you send “a separate description of the nature and general content of the work—for example, a shooting script, a synopsis, or a pressbook.”

However, we have not received any of those items from you.

If you have an electronic version of any of the above items, you can send it as an attachment in reply to this email. If you only have physical copies, you can mail one to the address below:
