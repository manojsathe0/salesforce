    <subject>Your Copyright Registration – Scanning Materials for E-Filing</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for contacting us about scanning your physical materials to submit with your Copyright registration application.

In some instances, the U.S. Copyright Office allows electronic deposit copies to be submitted with applications. In doing so, your Copyright registration may benefit from shorter processing times. We scanned your physical material deposit and converted it to an electronic version to take advantage of this.

Please Note: LegalZoom does not share your materials with any third party unless necessary for the completion of your order.  Furthermore, LegalZoom does not retain physical copies of your submissions, and will not be held responsible for returning those materials to you. Any materials not submitted to the U.S. Copyright Office will be securely destroyed.

If you have any questions or would like additional information, simply reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to serving you soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
