    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

You indicated on your application a publication date for the work you are seeking to register. However, the work you submitted to accompany your application lists multiple publication dates. 

The U.S. Copyright Office allows only one publication date to be listed for a work. If you submitted to us a revised version of an older work, provide the date this latest version was published. 

In order for us to proceed with your application, please reply to this email as soon as possible with the correct date (Month/Day/Year).

If you have any questions or would like additional information, simply reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
