    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

During review of your file, we noticed that the music and lyrics portions of the work were contributed by different authors than the sound recording portions of the work.

According to the US Copyright Office, “A musical composition and a sound recording may be registered together on a single application if ownership of the Copyrights in both is exactly the same.&quot;

You can view more Copyright information for sound recordings here.

After reviewing this information, please contact us by replying to this email or calling us at the number below to let us know how you wish to proceed:

1) Remove one or more authors off the Copyright application – indicate which author(s) should be removed.
2) Update the contributions of all authors to be the same – indicate the common contributions that should be listed on the Copyright application, for example “lyrics, music, and recording/production.”
3) Submit the Copyright application as is.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
