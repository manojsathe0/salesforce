    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

There appears to be a problem with your order. Your application will not be filed with the U.S. Copyright Office until this problem is resolved, so please respond to this email as soon as possible.

Specifically, in the questionnaire, you indicated that the work was created under a pseudonym (fictitious name). However, you did not provide the pseudonym.

If the work was created under a pseudonym, please confirm the pseudonym that you would like listed in the application. If the work was NOT created under a pseudonym, please let us know if your application should be revised to indicate that the work is not pseudonymous.

If you have any questions or would like additional information, you can reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT.

We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
