    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom.

Regarding your inquiry, the Copyright Office explicitly states that [INSERT NON COPYRIGHTABLE WORK DESCRIPTION] cannot be protected by Copyright. For more information, see here.

Copyright protects “original works of authorship” that are fixed in a tangible form of expression such as a literary, musical, dramatic or artistic work.

According to the U.S. Copyright Office, there are several categories of material that are generally not eligible for federal Copyright protection. These include:

•	Works that have not been fixed in a tangible form of expression (such as an idea, or a speech that was neither written down nor recorded)
•	Titles, names, short phrases and slogans (see below), familiar symbols or designs, etc.
•	Ideas, procedures, methods, systems, processes, concepts, principles, etc.
•	Works consisting entirely of information that is common property and contains no authorship

For more information, check out the following sources:

• Difference between a trademark and Copyright
• Works protected by Copyright
• Works not protected by Copyright
• U.S. Copyright Office circular on works not protected by Copyright
