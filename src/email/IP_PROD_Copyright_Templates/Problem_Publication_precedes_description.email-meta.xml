    <subject>Order on Hold: Copyright Application Publication Date/Completion Year Inconsistency [Order #]</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

There appears to be a problem with your order. Your application will not be filed with the U.S. Copyright Office until this problem is resolved, so please respond to this email as soon as possible.

Specifically, in the questionnaire, you indicated that the year in which creation of the work was completed is [YYYY]. However, you also indicated that the date of first publication of the work was [MM/DD/YYYY]. The publication date cannot precede the year in which creation of the work was completed.

To resolve this problem, please reply to this email and indicate the following:

1.  The year of completion for the work [YYYY]

2.  The date of first publication of the work [MM/DD/YYYY].

If you have any questions or would like additional information, you can reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT.
