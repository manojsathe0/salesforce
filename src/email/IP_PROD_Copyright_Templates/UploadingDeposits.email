Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

<br/><br/>
We have not yet received a copy of your work. To complete your application for copyright registration, you must send us a complete copy (and, in certain circumstances, two complete copies) of the work that you are seeking to register (called “deposit materials”). 

<br/><br/>
Information about published works can be found <a href=http://legalzoom.force.com/LZPKB/articles/Answer/475?retURL=%2Fapex%2FknowledgeHome&popup=false&lang=en_US>here</a>.

<br/> <br/>

<b><u>Standard Mail Submissions</b></u>
<br/>
To provide hard copies of an unpublished work by mail, please send <b>one complete copy</b> of the work to the address below. 
<p>
If your published work is eligible for electronic submission (see below for more information), but you wish to provide hard copies of a work by mail, please send <b>one complete copy</b> of the work to the address below. Otherwise, please submit <b>two complete copies</b>. 
<p>
<b>Please note:</b> If you submit a hard copy and your work is eligible for electronic conversion to upload via the electronic Copyright Office (eCO) website, we may convert your work into electronic file(s) and securely destroy the hard copy you submit to our office. 
<p>
When sending in the materials, please include a cover letter that references the order number and indicates whether each copy you are providing is a copy of the same work or copies of more than one work.
Materials should be sent to the following address:

<br><br>

<b><u>Electronic Submissions </b></u><br>
You can submit your work electronically if it falls within one of the following categories:
<ol>
<li>Unpublished works
<li>Works published only electronically (for example, a website or computer program)
<li>Published works for which the deposit requirement is identifying material (for example, a three-dimensional work)
</ol>

If your materials consist of more than one file or attachment, please indicate in your email whether each file or attachment is a copy of the same work or copies of more than one work.
