    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom.

The way in which Copyright protection is secured is frequently misunderstood. No publication or registration or other action in the Copyright Office is required to secure Copyright. Copyright protection subsists from the time the work is created in fixed form. The Copyright in the work of authorship immediately becomes the property of the author who created the work. Only the author or those deriving their rights through the author can rightfully claim Copyright.

The use of a Copyright notice is no longer required under U.S. law, although it is often beneficial. Because prior law did contain such a requirement, however, the use of notice is still relevant to the Copyright status of older works.
