    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

While reviewing your Copyright application, we noticed a potential issue that may delay your registration with the US Copyright Office.

We need to confirm whether your work has only been published online, or if it had been printed in physical form and made available to the public. If the work was published physically, the US Copyright Office requires two hard copies of the published version for your work to be submitted with your application.

To process your Copyright application without further delay, please call me at the number and extension below at your earliest convenience.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
