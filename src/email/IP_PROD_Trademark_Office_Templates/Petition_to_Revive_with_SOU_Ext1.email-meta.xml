    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

The filing receipt for your petition to revive your abandoned Trademark application is included in this email. You can track the status online using your assigned serial number.

An examiner from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) will review your request and, if it is approved, your Trademark application will be revived. Your deadline to submit a new Statement of Use or request an extension of time to file your Statement of Use will be extended for an additional six (6) months from the original date of expiration (not from the approval date).

If your Petition to Revive is approved, please be sure to file one of these two forms on time to avoid abandonment. Visit us for more information.

If you have any questions or would like additional information, simply reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to serving you again soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
