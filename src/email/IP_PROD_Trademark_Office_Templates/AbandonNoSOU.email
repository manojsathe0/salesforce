  <td style="padding:15px 15px 15px 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:11.5px; line-height:17px; border:1px solid #CCCCCC;">Dear {!Contact.FirstName},<br/><br/>Thank you for contacting LegalZoom.<br/><br/>Based on the records of the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), your Trademark application has been deemed abandoned because you did not file a Statement of Use or Request for Extension of Time to File a Statement of Use within the required 6-month period following your Notice of Allowance.<br/><br/>Your Notice of Abandonment was issued on DD/MM/YYYY. You have two (2) months from that date to file a Petition to Revive your application, should you decide to continue with the application process. If you do not file a Petition to Revive, your application will remain abandoned. If you would like to file a Petition to Revive, additional fees will apply. Please review the following:<ul><li>If you did not receive your Notice of Allowance, the USPTO grants you two (2) months from the date your Notice of Abandonment was issued to file a Petition to Revive, and charges you $100 to submit it. Once the USPTO receives and approves your Petition to Revive, a new Notice of Allowance will be issued. Please note that this process may take several months. <br/><br/><li>If you did receive your Notice of Allowance, the USPTO grants you two (2) months from the date you found out about the abandonment to file your Petition to Revive and charges you $100 to submit the form. Note: you must have been diligent in checking the status of your application every six (6) months. An Extension Request will be included with your Petition to Revive form. This will allow you to submit your Statement of Use immediately after the USPTO has reviewed and approved your Petition to Revive and Extension Request. Additionally, the USPTO charges $150 per class of goods and/or services indicated on your original application when you submit your Extension Request.<br/></ul>LegalZoom provides this service at no additional charge to its customers: you will be charged only those fees required by the USPTO.
