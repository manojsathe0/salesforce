The opposition is currently awaiting review by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board and you will be contacted directly regarding the that review. If you wish to view and/or download a copy of your proceeding file, please the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board Inquiry System <a href=http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/>here</a>.<br/><br/>We realize that this can be a frustrating development and we sympathize. Please be assured your Trademark application was completed according to the letter of your directions and filed properly and in a timely fashion with the USPTO.<br/><br/>Our customers use LegalZoom to save time and money, largely by alleviating the need for attorney assistance on certain matters. However, LegalZoom is neither a law firm nor are we a substitute for one. LegalZoom is precluded from giving legal advice of any kind and we perform our services at our customer&#8217;s specfic direction. At no time do we review answers for legal sufficiency, draw legal conclusions, provide legal advice or apply the law to the facts of a particular situation.<br/><br/>Because each opposition has unique facts, you should consider contacting an attorney with experience in this area. LegalZoom can put you in touch with an experienced trademark attorney*.<br/><br/>Please feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.<br/><br/>Best regards,<br/><br/>The LegalZoom Team<br/>___________________________________<br/><br/>* {!snippetVariable.tmoa_bap}<br/> </p></div>
