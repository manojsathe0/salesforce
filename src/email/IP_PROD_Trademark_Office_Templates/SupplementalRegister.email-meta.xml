    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

The Supplemental Register is a secondary list of registered Trademarks maintained by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Trademarks on the Supplemental Register do not qualify for registration on the Principal Register, and therefore these marks do not receive many of the benefits of registration available to Trademarks on the Principal Register.

However, registration on the Supplemental Register allows the Trademark owner to use the ® symbol next to their Trademark, and also provides notice to potential users of the Trademark (or one that is confusingly similar) that it is most likely already being used. Once a Trademark develops “secondary meaning” (meaning that, because of extensive use, consumers associate it with a particular business or source of goods/services), or has been on the Supplemental Register for five years, the mark owner may petition to have it moved to the Principal Register.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
