Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
<p>
The filing receipt for your petition to revive your abandoned Trademark application is included in this email. You can track the status <a href=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/>online</a> using your assigned serial number. 
<p>
An examiner from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) will review your request and, if it is approved, a new Notice of Allowance will be issued after your application completes the opposition period. This process can take up to 3 months.
<p>
Once a new Notice of Allowance is issued, you will have six (6) months to either file a Statement of Use or a request for an extension of time to file your Statement of Use. If you do not file either of these forms within 6 months of the mailing date on your Notice of Allowance, your application will be deemed abandoned.  Visit <a href=http://www.legalzoom.com/Trademarks-Patents-Copyrights/Trademark-ancillary-products-overview.html>us</a> for more information.   
<p>
If you have any questions or would like additional information, simply reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT.
<p>
We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.
<p>
Best regards,
<p>
The LegalZoom Team
