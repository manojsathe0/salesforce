    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

The filing receipt for your petition to revive your abandoned Trademark application is included in this email. You can track the status online using your assigned serial number.

An examiner from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) will review your request and, if it is approved, a new Notice of Allowance will be issued after your application completes the opposition period. This process can take up to 3 months.

Once a new Notice of Allowance is issued, you will have six (6) months to either file a Statement of Use or a request for an extension of time to file your Statement of Use. If you do not file either of these forms within 6 months of the mailing date on your Notice of Allowance, your application will be deemed abandoned.  Visit us for more information.

If you have any questions or would like additional information, simply reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
