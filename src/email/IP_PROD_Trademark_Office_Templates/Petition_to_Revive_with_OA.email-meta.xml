    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

The filing receipt for your petition to revive your abandoned Trademark application is included in this email. You can track the status online using your assigned serial number.

An examiner from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) will review your request and, if it is approved, your Trademark application will be revived and published for opposition.  Your application will then proceed as normal.

If you have any questions or would like additional information, simply reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to serving you again soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
