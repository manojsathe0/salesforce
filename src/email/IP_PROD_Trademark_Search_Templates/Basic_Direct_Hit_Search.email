Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 
<br><br>
We have conducted a Basic Federal Direct-Hit Search of your proposed Trademark, and have attached a report with your results to this email. 
<br><br>
<b>Your Next Steps </b> <br>
Please review the attached materials carefully. Once your review is complete, please reply to this email and tell us how you want to proceed. Your options are:
<br><br>
1.	LegalZoom will process and file your Trademark application as is. <br><br>
2.	Submit a different name or logo — this means you can either update your previous submission or create a new mark altogether. You will receive a FREE Basic Federal Direct-Hit Search of the different mark (up to three searches are included with your Trademark application order). <br><br>
3.	Consult with an attorney about your Trademark and search results.* <br><br>
4.	Upgrade your order with a Comprehensive Trademark Search for more coverage of possible conflicts, including unregistered uses of marks similar to your proposed Trademark in commerce (for example, in business and website domain names). 
<br><br>
<b>Please note: </b>If you want us to delay the processing of your Trademark application, contact us within 7 days from the date of this email. Otherwise, we will proceed with filing your Trademark application as is.
<br/><br/>Please feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.
<br><br>
We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.
<br><br>
Best regards,
<br><br>
The LegalZoom Team
