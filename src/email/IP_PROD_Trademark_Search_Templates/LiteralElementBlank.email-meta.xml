    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 

After reviewing your order, it appears that you have left the literal element section of your application blank. The literal element is made up of any words, letters, or punctuation on your logo. 

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires your logo to display the exact literal element listed in the application. No additional words, letters or punctuation marks may appear on your application if they are not on your logo. To read more about the literal element, visit: http://legalzoom.force.com/LZPKB/articles/Answer/2396

Please reply and indicate how the literal element should be listed on your application (we will also complete your comprehensive search based on this information), and include a copy of your logo.

----------------------------------

SUBMITTING YOUR LOGO: 

Please reply to this e-mail and attach your logo sample, preferably in .jpg, .jpeg, .gif or .pdf format. Email attachments cannot exceed 6MB.
