    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We have received your logo; however, we are unable to conduct a design search. In order to conduct a design search, your logo must contain distinct design elements, such as flowers, hearts, multiple geometric shapes, etc. 

***Please note that fonts are not considered to be searchable design elements.***

Because LegalZoom cannot conduct a search on your logo, we will issue a refund of $250 for the cancellation of your design search. The refund will be applied to your original account, and will take 5-7 business days to be reflected.
We apologize for any inconveniences. 

Please feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
