    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

In its review of your Trademark application, the USPTO will search federal records for conflicts between your proposed mark and any other registered or pending mark. In general, the USPTO will reject an application if it finds that there would be a “likelihood of consumer confusion” between your mark and another mark. Marks, goods, and/or services do not have to be identical for the USPTO to come to this conclusion. A number of factors are considered by the USPTO to determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists, including:

The similarity of the marks in appearance, sound, and meaning.
Whether the marks are used to sell similar kinds of goods or services.
The number of similar marks currently in use.
The similarity of established sales channels and the sophistication of the buyers.
