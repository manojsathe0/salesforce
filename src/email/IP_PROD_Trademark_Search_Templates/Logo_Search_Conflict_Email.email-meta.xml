    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We have conducted a Basic Federal Direct-Hit Logo Search of your proposed logo design, and have attached a report with your results to this email.

Your Next Steps
Please review the attached materials carefully. Once your review is complete, please reply to this email and tell us how you want to proceed. Your options are:

1.     LegalZoom will process and file your Trademark application as is.

2.     Submit a different logo — this means you can either update your previous submission or create a new one altogether. You will receive an updated Basic Federal Direct-Hit Logo Search of the different logo design (up to three searches are included with your Trademark application order).

3.     Consult with an attorney about your Trademark and search results.*

Please note: If you want us to delay the processing of your Trademark application, contact us within 7 days from the date of this email. Otherwise, we will proceed with filing your Trademark application as is.

If you have any questions or would like additional information, simply reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
