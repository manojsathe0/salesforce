    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We are currently working on your logo search; however, we need a visual copy of your logo to ensure that the search we conduct will be accurate. 

----------------------------------

SUBMITTING YOUR LOGO: 

Please reply to this e-mail and attach your logo sample, preferably in .jpg, .jpeg, .gif or .pdf format. Email attachments cannot exceed 6MB. 

If you are using a Mac computer or your attachments are larger than 6MB combined, please upload your image(s) directly here: http://legalzoom.force.com/LZWTC 

Or, if you prefer, you can mail us your materials. Our mailing address is: 

{!snippetVariable.ip_address_tm_materials}

Please note: LegalZoom will not share your materials with any third party unless necessary for the completion of your order. Furthermore, LegalZoom does not retain physical copies of your submissions, and will not be held responsible for returning those materials to you. 

----------------------------------

We will begin your search upon receipt of your logo. From then, you should receive your search results via email in 2-3 business days.

If you have any questions or would like additional information, simply reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and we look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
