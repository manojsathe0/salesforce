    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for using LegalZoom.

The description of goods and services for your Trademark application may be inadequate. The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires a specific list of goods and services for each Trademark. Such descriptions are vital to the USPTO, as they are used to group each Trademark within a specific International Classification. An example of a specific description may include &quot;Apparel, namely hats, t-shirts, sweatshirts&quot; or &quot;a retail store selling [insert goods sold here]&quot;.

Please visit {!snippetVariable.tm_gs_manual} to view more of the USPTO&apos;s list of acceptable descriptions for goods and services. To use this tool, enter specific keywords (i.e. &quot;clothing&quot;) and a listing of descriptions will appear with the appropriate class numbers. You can adopt any of the descriptions displayed that are appropriate.

**Please note that if you have paid for one class, each additional class will require a $385 fee.**

Because LegalZoom is prohibited by law from giving legal advice, it is our customers&apos; responsibility to develop a goods and services description that is appropriate for their Trademark. Although inadequate goods and services descriptions are often able to be amended after a Trademark application has been filed, the scope of the description cannot be broadened. Such amendments may also delay the registration process. ***LegalZoom will not file Trademark amendments on behalf of customers.***
