  <td style="padding:15px 15px 15px 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:11.5px; line-height:17px; border:1px solid #CCCCCC;">Dear {!Contact.FirstName},<br/><br/>Thank you for using LegalZoom.<br/><br/>The description of goods and services for your Trademark application may be inadequate. The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires a specific list of goods and services for each Trademark. Such descriptions are vital to the USPTO, as they are used to group each Trademark within a specific International Classification. An example of a specific description may include &#34;Apparel, namely hats, t-shirts, sweatshirts&#34; or &#34;a retail store selling [insert goods sold here]&#34;. <br/> <br/>Please visit {!snippetVariable.tm_gs_manual} to view more of the USPTO&#39;s list of acceptable descriptions for goods and services. To use this tool, enter specific keywords (i.e. &#34;clothing&#34;) and a listing of descriptions will appear with the appropriate class numbers. You can adopt any of the descriptions displayed that are appropriate.<br/> <br/>**Please note that if you have paid for one class, each additional class will require a $385 fee.**<br/><br/>Because LegalZoom is prohibited by law from giving legal advice, it is our customers&#39; responsibility to develop a goods and services description that is appropriate for their Trademark. Although inadequate goods and services descriptions are often able to be amended after a Trademark application has been filed, the scope of the description cannot be broadened. Such amendments may also delay the registration process. ***LegalZoom will not file Trademark amendments on behalf of customers.*** <br/><br/>For more information relating to goods and services, as well as International Classifications, visit {!snippetVariable.tm_resources_guides}<br/><br/>Feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.<br/><br/>Thank you again for choosing LegalZoom.<br/><br/>Best regards,<br/><br/>LegalZoom {!snippetVariable.ipdtm_dept_full}<br/>{!snippetVariable.ccphone} | {!snippetVariable.lz_address}<br/>{!snippetVariable.lz_website}<br/> </p></div>
