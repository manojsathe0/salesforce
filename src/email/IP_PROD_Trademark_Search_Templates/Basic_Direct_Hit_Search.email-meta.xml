    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We have conducted a Basic Federal Direct-Hit Search of your proposed Trademark, and have attached a report with your results to this email.

Your Next Steps
Please review the attached materials carefully. Once your review is complete, please reply to this email and tell us how you want to proceed. Your options are:

1.	LegalZoom will process and file your Trademark application as is.

2.	Submit a different name or logo — this means you can either update your previous submission or create a new mark altogether. You will receive a FREE Basic Federal Direct-Hit Search of the different mark (up to three searches are included with your Trademark application order).

3.	Consult with an attorney about your Trademark and search results.*

4.	Upgrade your order with a Comprehensive Trademark Search for more coverage of possible conflicts, including unregistered uses of marks similar to your proposed Trademark in commerce (for example, in business and website domain names).

Please note: If you want us to delay the processing of your Trademark application, contact us within 7 days from the date of this email. Otherwise, we will proceed with filing your Trademark application as is.

If you have any questions or would like additional information, simply reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
