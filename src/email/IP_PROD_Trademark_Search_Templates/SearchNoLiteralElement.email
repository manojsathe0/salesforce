Your application indicates there are no words or standard characters within your Trademark design.

Otherwise, we will continue with your order without a preliminary search.<br/><br/>To complete a logo search, a copy of your logo is required; please reply to this e-mail and attach a black-and-white image of your logo, preferably in .jpg, .jpeg, .gif or .pdf format. Alternately, you can send the logo to us by mail: <br/><br/>{!snippetVariable.ip_address_tm_materials}<br/><br/>Otherwise, you can upload your image directly by visiting the <a href=http://legalzoom.force.com/LZWTC>Ask A Question</a>
