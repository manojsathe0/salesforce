    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Your application indicates there are no words or standard characters within your Trademark design. Please note that LegalZoom&apos;s basic search can only be conducted on the words and/or standard characters contained within a Trademark, also referred to as the &quot;literal element.&quot; Logo searches are optional for an additional $250.

If you would like to upgrade your order with a federal logo search, please call us at the number listed below to submit your payment information. Otherwise, we will continue with your order without a preliminary search.

To complete a logo search, a copy of your logo is required; please reply to this e-mail and attach a black-and-white image of your logo, preferably in .jpg, .jpeg, .gif or .pdf format. Alternately, you can send the logo to us by mail:

{!snippetVariable.ip_address_tm_materials}

Otherwise, you can upload your image directly by visiting the Ask A Question section of LegalZoom&apos;s Support Center .

With this in mind, please reply to this email and indicate how you would like to proceed with your application.

If you have any questions or would like additional information, simply reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
