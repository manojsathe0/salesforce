    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for using LegalZoom.

Per your request, we will update your mark to: XXXXXXX

Please also review the following information regarding your Trademark application:

Filing format: XXXXXXX
Filing basis: XXXXXXXX

If the above information needs to be updated, reply to this email and indicate your changes. At this point, we will continue with your comprehensive search. The results will be shipped in 5-7 business days.

You will also be able to review your mark before signing off your completed application, which will be the last step of LegalZoom&apos;s process. Please note that once your application is submitted to the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), you cannot change your mark, or broaden the scope of your goods and services description.

Feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.
