    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We have been working on your Comprehensive Trademark Search order, but the results found are too broad for us to complete this process. Comprehensive searches generally find marks that are similar in name, sound, appearance, and meaning within related classes of products (&quot;goods&quot;) and services. The search for registered and pending marks is conducted within the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database, as well as 50 state databases.

If you wish to opt for our basic direct-hit search, we will credit your account $XXX for the service. Our direct-hit search is conducted within the USPTO for marks within the same class of your products and services. Instead of receiving a comprehensive report, you will receive an email listing potential conflicts.

LegalZoom is not a law firm and is unable to give legal advice. When we find similar Trademarks, our purpose is to give you enough information to make an informed decision on how you would like to proceed.

Please note that our inability to conduct a comprehensive search does not reflect the registrability of your Trademark. In general, the USPTO will reject an application only if there is a &quot;likelihood of consumer confusion&quot; within the same or related class of goods or services. Some factors may include:

The similarity of the marks in appearance, sound and meaning.
The relatedness of the goods or service.
The number of similar marks currently in use.
The similarity of established sales channels and the sophistication of the buyers.

Below are some links to additional information.

Please let us know how you wish to continue with this order. If you cannot make a decision and wish to schedule a consultation with an attorney, visit us here.

If you have any questions or would like additional information, simply reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
