    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for considering LegalZoom for your Intellectual Property needs.

Upon receipt of your completed e-signature, LegalZoom pays the required filing fee and files your document.  In addition, LegalZoom sends you a packet containing hard copies of your application materials.  These materials include your United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) serial number, which allows you to track the status of your application online at http://tsdr.uspto.gov. (Note*: After receiving your serial number, please allow 3-4 weeks before checking the status). 

To track the status of your application, type your serial number into the ?Enter a Number? prompt on the left side of the page.  Your serial number can be found within the final documents you receive from LegalZoom on the sheet entitled &quot;Success.&quot;

Your application will be assigned to a Trademark Examining Attorney approximately six months after it was submitted. The assigned attorney will contact you via phone, email, regular mail, or fax should any changes or amendments be needed to prepare your trademark for registration.  

The complete process typically takes eight to thirteen months, but in some cases can take longer.  Your trademark is not considered Registered until you have received official documentation and a notification of registration from the USPTO.

You are precluded from using the circle R symbol until the mark has officially been registered by the USPTO, however, you can use the &quot;TM&quot; or &quot;SM&quot; symbol at any time to show ownership of the mark.
