    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for considering LegalZoom for your Intellectual Property needs.

Your trademark order #XXXXXX was submitted to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on XX/XX/XXXX.

Once LegalZoom has completed your trademark application and has made all necessary payments, all correspondences should be forwarded directly to the USPTO. Because LegalZoom is not a law firm, we are unable to provide legal advice or act as an attorney on your behalf.

If you need to file any additional forms, they can be found online at http://www.uspto.gov/teas/index.html.

For further instructions, you can contact the Trademark Assistance Center at 1.800.786.9199. If you live in Northern Virginia, the number is 1.703.308.9000.
