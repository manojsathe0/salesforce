    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for considering LegalZoom for your Intellectual Property needs.

For goods, &quot;Interstate commerce&quot; involves sending the goods across state lines with the mark displayed on the goods or the packaging for the goods. 

With services, &quot;Interstate commerce&quot; involves offering a service to those in another state or rendering a service that affects interstate commerce (e.g. restaurants, gas stations, hotels, etc.).
