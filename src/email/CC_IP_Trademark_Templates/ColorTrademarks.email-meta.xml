    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for considering LegalZoom for your Intellectual Property needs.

If you are interested in submitting a color mark for your trademark application, please reply to this e-mail and provide the following information:
 
(1) A color claim naming the colors that are a feature of the mark; and (2) a separate statement describing where the color(s) appear on the mark. A color drawing will not be published without these statements. 

For example, a properly worded color claim would read as follows:

The color(s) &lt;name the color(s)&gt; are claimed as a distinctive feature of the mark.

For example, a properly worded description would read as follows:

The color(s) &lt;name the color(s)&gt; appear in &lt;specify portion of mark on which color(s) appear&gt;.

If the color claim or description is unclear or ambiguous, the examining attorney will require clarification. The written description of the mark must include a generic description of the color, in addition to a reference to the commercial color identification system.
