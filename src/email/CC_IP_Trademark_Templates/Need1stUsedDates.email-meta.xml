You indicated on your application that you are currently using your trademark in commerce. To file your application on a ?use in commerce? basis, you must show proof that you have used the mark in the ordinary course of trade and are not simply reserving rights in the mark.

In order to proceed with your trademark application, you must provide the following:

1. Date of first use anywhere ? month and year
2. Date of first use in commerce ? month and year

Your use-based application will include your sworn statement, the dates you provide above, and a specimen or example of your use of the mark in commerce. NOTE: Dates in the future may not be used. The USPTO requires the trademark be used in commerce prior to the submission of your application.

Please call or email us as soon as possible to provide your information at (800) 773-0888 Monday?Friday from 6 a.m.?7p.m. PT or customercare@legalzoom.com.
