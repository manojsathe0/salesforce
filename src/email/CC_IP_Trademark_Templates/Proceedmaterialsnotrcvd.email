Dear {!Contact.FirstName},<br /><br />

Per your request, I have informed a product specialist to continue with the process of your trademark order. <br /><br />

Please note we require that you submit two (2) items: <br /><br />

1. A sample of your logo. Please note that only one logo can be submitted per application. A black and white sample allows your logo to be protected without limiting the colors that can be used with or within it. A color sample, on the other hand, limits your trademark to the specific colors used, and must be accompanied by a “color claim,” listing the colors you want to limit yourself to, and stating where on your logo you use each color. <br /><br />

2. Proof of use (called a “specimen”). The specimen you provide should be an actual, real-world example that clearly shows how the trademark is being used in connection with the products (“goods”) and/or services you listed in your application. Unlike your logo sample, your specimen can be in color without limiting the colors you can use with or within your trademark later. <br /><br />

******************For services****************** <br /><br />

If you are providing services, acceptable specimens include a sign, brochure, advertisement, business card, stationary or website prominently displaying your trademark in connection with the services you’ve listed in your trademark filing. The specimen must include a reference to the service, not just the trademark by itself. Printer’s proofs for advertisements or news articles about your services are generally NOT acceptable specimens for services. <br /><br />

******************For products****************** <br /><br />

If you are providing products, acceptable specimens include photographs of packaging labels, clothing tags or labels on containers that prominently display your trademark. Invoices, order forms, receipts, brochures, catalogs, press releases, business cards, and stationery are generally NOT acceptable specimens for products. <br /><br />
