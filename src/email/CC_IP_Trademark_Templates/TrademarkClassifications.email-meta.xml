    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for considering LegalZoom for your Intellectual Property needs.

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) breaks down all products and services into 45 classifications. Based on the description of goods and/or services listed on your application, the USPTO will assign a class to your application.

Classification is also the basis for determining the number of fees which must be paid. One product or service is ordinarily classified in a single class, unless it has many uses. For example, if a mark used to identify a brand of motorcycles also becomes a brand for clothing, then two classes are required. 

The USPTO associates the following word titles with the respective trademark class numbers: 

Products (&quot;Goods&quot;):

1. Chemicals 
2. Paints 
3. Cosmetics and cleaning preparations 
4. Lubricants and fuels 
5. Pharmaceuticals
