    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for submitting a logo for your trademark application. However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office requires the literal element (word description) from your application match the graphic element (logo) exactly. It cannot contain additional words, letters or punctuation or be missing any words, letters or punctuation.

Currently, your logo and literal element are the following:

Logo: No words or standard characters
Literal element: [insert]

To correct the inconsistency and continue with your application, we need to know how you would like to proceed. Choose ONE of the options below and reply to this email:

1. Submit a different logo that matches the literal element you provided in your application

2. Request to change the application to remove all words and characters in the literal element section*

3. Confirm you want us to submit the logo and literal element as is. During the examination process by the USPTO, you will be responsible to respond to questions from your assigned examining attorney

4. Request to place your order on hold while you consult with an attorney**

You can find out more information on literal elements at the following link:
