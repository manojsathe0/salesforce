    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for submitting a specimen for your trademark application. However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office requires the specimen match the literal element (word description) from your application exactly. It cannot contain additional words, letters or punctuation or be missing any words, letters or punctuation.

Currently, your specimen and literal element are the following:

Specimen: [insert]
Literal element: [insert]

To correct the inconsistency and continue with your application, we need to know how you would like to proceed. Choose ONE of the options below and reply to this email:

1. Submit a different specimen that matches the literal element you provided in your application

2. Request to change the application to match the literal element displayed on your specimen

3. Confirm you want us to submit the specimen and literal element as is. During the examination process by the USPTO, you will be responsible to respond to questions from your assigned examining attorney

4. Request to place your order on hold while you consult with an attorney*

If you have any questions or would like additional information, please call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday?Friday from 6 a.m.?7p.m. PT or email us at customercare@legalzoom.com.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.
