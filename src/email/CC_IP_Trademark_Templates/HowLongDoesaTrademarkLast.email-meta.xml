    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

For a trademark registration to remain valid, you must take action to ensure the proper documents are filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). There are a few different types of documents required, depending on the length of time following the original registration date. See below:

Between years 5-6*: Section 8 Declaration of Continued Use or Excusable Nonuse
Between years 9-10*: Combined Section 8 Declaration/Section 9 Trademark Renewal
Every 10 years thereafter: Combined Section 8 Declaration/Section 9 Trademark Renewal

Filing the Section 8 Declaration tells the USPTO that your trademark is still being used in commerce in the way in which you claimed on your registration (of you have an acceptable reason for its nonuse). Renewal of your trademark is required for your registration to remain valid for the next term (see below for term duration).

Term duration: Trademark registrations granted PRIOR to November 16, 1989 have a 20-year term, and ON or AFTER that date, a 10-year term. The same goes for renewal periods. Renewals granted PRIOR to November 16, 1989 have a 20-year term, and renewals granted ON or AFTER that date, a 10-year term.
