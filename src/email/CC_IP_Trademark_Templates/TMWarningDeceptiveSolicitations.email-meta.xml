    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for considering LegalZoom for your Intellectual Property needs.

LegalZoom.com takes pride in giving our customers reliable and efficient service, and as such would like to warn you about the possibility of deceptive solicitations.

When your trademark application was submitted to the United States Patent Trademark Office (USPTO), it was automatically published in the Federal Trademark Database. As part of this process, all information provided on your application became public.

You may receive letters from third parties requesting you pay for monitoring and notification services. Some of these companies may even deceive you into believing that they come from the government. Please know that you are in no way obligated to remit payment, and this service does not affect your trademark application. 

These letters will contain your personal information, but note that this is easily obtainable from the Federal Trademark Database. As part of our privacy policy, LegalZoom does not sell or forward your personal information to anyone. 

If you have any questions, please call the USPTO at 1.800.786.9199 or visit www.uspto.gov.
