    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for considering LegalZoom for your Intellectual Property needs.

We have received your black-and-white logo; however, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires that the literal element contained within the logo be completely identical to the literal element listed in the application.  No additional words, letters or punctuation marks may appear on your logo if they are not listed on the application.  Your literal element as specified on LegalZoom&apos;s preliminary application is &quot;[NAME ON APPLICATION]&quot;.  However, the black-and-white logo you sent us displays the literal element &quot;[NAME ON LOGO]&quot;.  

***We cannot proceed with the submission of your application to the USPTO unless the literal element on the logo matches the literal element on the application.***

To resolve this issue, please reply to this email and select ONE of the following options:  

1.  Submit a different logo that matches the literal element as specified on the application, or...   

2.  Amend the application to match the literal element displayed on the current logo.  

With this in mind, please reply to this email and let me know how you would like us to proceed with your application.
