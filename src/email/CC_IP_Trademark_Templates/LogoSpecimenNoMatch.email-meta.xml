    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for submitting a specimen for your trademark application. However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires the logo on the specimen match the graphic element (logo) from your application exactly.

To correct the inconsistency and continue with your application, we need to know how you would like to proceed. Choose ONE of the options below and reply to this email:

1. Submit a different logo that matches the one that appears on your specimen

2. Submit a different specimen that displays the exact logo you provided in your application

3. Confirm you want us to submit the specimen and logo as is. During the examination process by the USPTO, you will be responsible to respond to questions from your assigned examining attorney

4. Request to place your order on hold while you consult with an attorney*

If you have any questions or would like additional information, please call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday?Friday from 6 a.m.?7p.m. PT or email us at customercare@legalzoom.com.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
