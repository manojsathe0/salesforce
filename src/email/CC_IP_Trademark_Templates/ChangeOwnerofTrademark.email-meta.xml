    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for contacting us about trademark assignments. 

When a registered trademark is assigned from one party to another, the U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office (USPTO) recommends that you file a trademark assignment recordation form so that the office can maintain current trademark ownership records.

LegalZoom can help you record your trademark assignment with the USPTO. For more information or to get started, go to https://www.LegalZoom.com/Trademarks-assignment/Trademarks-assignment-overview.html. 

If you have any questions or would like additional information, please call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday?Friday from 6 a.m.?7p.m. PT or email us at customercare@legalzoom.com.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
