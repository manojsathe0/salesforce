    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs. 

A Family Limited Partnership is a business entity comprised of two or more partners who operate or manage a business together.  In every Family Limited Partnership (FLP), there are two types of partners?general partners and limited partners.

General partners control the company&apos;s day-to-day operations and take on the legal debts and obligations of the business.  Because they are responsible for any debts or lawsuits incurred by the company, general partners frequently also form corporations or LLCs to protect themselves from liability.

Limited partners contribute capital to the partnership but do not participate in the daily operations of the company. As an added benefit, they are also shielded from company debts and other liabilities. Limited partnerships are a great choice for individuals who lack the time or expertise to run a business but would like to share in the profits.

The Family Limited Partnership (FLP)?has also gained popularity in recent years. Designed more as a wealth transfer strategy than a business structure, the FLP allows individuals to transfer personal or business assets into a partnership and then grant limited ownership interests to their children or other family members. The FLP not only works to lower the taxable value of your estate, but also ensures that certain assets remain in the family.

For your convenience, I have provided additional information and links to begin your LP formation:

I recommend the Express Gold Package because it offers significant benefits. The Gold Package includes free preparation of your Tax ID application (for easy self-filing) OR a {!snippetVariable.ein_prep} discount toward LegalZoom&apos;s complete Tax ID Obtainment Service. Most importantly, it will expedite your filing process, reducing the waiting period to {!snippetVariable.goldlp_turnaround}. Other packages take {!snippetVariable.stdlp_turnaround}.

Also, you may want to consider using LegalZoom&apos;s Registered Agent Service. Setting up a registered agent is a state requirement for all FLPS.  LegalZoom&apos;s Registered Agent Service ensures professional handling of your company?s state correspondence and also helps ensure your privacy. We offer Registered Agent Services at an affordable rate of {!snippetVariable.ra_firstyrpackage} for the first year.
