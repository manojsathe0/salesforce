    <textOnly>Dear LegalZoom Customer:

At LegalZoom, we want to provide our customers with the best products and service possible.  If you could spend about 3 minutes answering a few questions in a customer survey, it would help us better understand how we can make improvements.  Since we know your time is valuable, we will provide you a discount code upon completion of the survey for $10 off any LegalZoom Business Product that we offer (excludes 3rd party services).  This one-time discount code will be valid until 4/30/10.

Please follow the link provided to begin this survey:

Thank you for your help,

The LegalZoom Team
