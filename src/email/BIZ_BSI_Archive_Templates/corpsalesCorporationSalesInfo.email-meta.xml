    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.

A corporation is a legal entity created under state laws.  Corporations can open their own bank account, purchase property, enter into contracts and operate a business. One of the most important advantages of a corporation is that generally, its owners are not personally liable for the debts of the corporation.

For your convenience, I have provided additional information and links to begin your incorporation formation:

Economy Incorporation Package {!snippetVariable.econcorp_pricing}
{!snippetVariable.econcorp_turnaround}
Standard Incorporation Package {!snippetVariable.stdcorp_pricing}
{!snippetVariable.stdcorp_turnaround}
Express Gold Incorporation Package {!snippetVariable.goldcorp_pricing}
{!snippetVariable.goldcorp_turnaround}

If you?d like LegalZoom to prepare the paperwork for an S-Corporation election, add  {!snippetVariable.prepscorp_pricing}. Or, if you?d prefer to have LegalZoom complete your S-Corporation election for you (includes preparation and filing), add {!snippetVariable.obtscorp_pricing}.

Get Started:
{!snippetVariable.corp_application}
Additional Pricing Information:
{!snippetVariable.corp_pricelink}
Education Center:
{!snippetVariable.corp_edcenter}

I recommend the Express Gold Package because it offers significant benefits. The Gold Package includes free preparation of your Tax ID application (for easy self-filing) OR a {!snippetVariable.ein_prep} discount toward LegalZoom&apos;s complete Tax ID Obtainment Service. Most importantly, it will expedite your filing process, reducing the waiting period to {!snippetVariable.goldcorp_turnaround}. Other packages take {!snippetVariable.stdcorp_turnaround}.

Also, you may want to consider using LegalZoom&apos;s Registered Agent Service. Setting up a registered agent is a state requirement for all corporations. LegalZoom&apos;s Registered Agent Service ensures professional handling of your company?s state correspondence and also helps ensure your privacy. We offer Registered Agent Services at an affordable rate of {!snippetVariable.ra_annual}.

If you have any further questions, please simply reply to this email, or feel free to call us toll-free at {!snippetVariable.bizbsi_phone} {!snippetVariable.bizbsi_hours}.

Best regards,

[ Your Name ]
