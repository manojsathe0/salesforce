    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.

A Limited Liability Partnership, or LLP, allows partners to take an active role in the business and enjoy limited personal liability. Professional service firms, such as accounting and law offices, often form as LLPs to utilize these advantages. LLPs offer both the flexibility of corporations and the tax benefits of partnerships, such as no double taxation on profits.

For your convenience, I have provided additional information and links to begin your LLP formation:

Economy LLP Package   {!snippetVariable.econllp_pricing}
{!snippetVariable.econllp_turnaround}
Standard LLP Package   {!snippetVariable.stdllp_pricing}
{!snippetVariable.stdllp_turnaround}
Express Gold LLP Package  {!snippetVariable.goldllp_pricing}
{!snippetVariable.goldllp_turnaround}

Get Started:

I recommend the Express Gold Package because it offers significant benefits. The Gold Package includes free preparation of your Tax ID application (for easy self-filing) OR a {!snippetVariable.ein_prep} discount toward LegalZoom&apos;s complete Tax ID Obtainment Service. Most importantly, it will expedite your filing process, reducing the waiting period to {!snippetVariable.goldllp_turnaround}. Other packages take econllp_turnaround.

Also, you may want to consider using LegalZoom&apos;s Registered Agent Service. Setting up a registered agent is a state requirement for all LLPs. LegalZoom&apos;s Registered Agent Service ensures professional handling of your company?s state correspondence and also helps ensure your privacy. We offer Registered Agent Services at an affordable rate of {!snippetVariable.ra_firstyrpackage} per year.

If you have any further questions, please simply reply to this email, or feel free to call us toll-free at $biz_phone $biz_hours.

Best regards,
