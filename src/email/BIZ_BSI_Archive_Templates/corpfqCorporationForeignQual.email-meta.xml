    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.

Foreign Qualification is the process by which your Corporation registers to do business in a state other than its home state.  Effectively, you will have one Corporation that is registered to do business in multiple states.  This will allow your Corporation to conduct business under the same name and use the same federal tax identification number in multiple states.

For your convenience, I have provided a summary of our Foreign Qualification fees:

Standard Foreign Qualification Package $stdfq_pricing
(20 to 35 business days)
Rush Foreign Qualification Package $rushfq_pricing
(10 to 15 business days)

To place your Foreign Qualification order, simply reply to this email or contact me by phone at $biz_phone  $biz_hours.  Please provide the following information:

1. Existing or pending LegalZoom order number
2. Name of Corporation
3. State of formation
4. Foreign Qualification state
5. Business address
6. Registered Agent name and address 

Best regards, 

[ Your Name ]
