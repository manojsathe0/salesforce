    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.

A non-profit corporation is a special type of corporation that has been organized for specific tax-exempt purposes. To qualify for non-profit status, your corporation must be formed to benefit (1.) the public, (2.) a specific group of individuals or (3.) the membership of the non-profit. Examples of non-profits include religious organizations, charitable organizations, political organizations, credit unions and membership clubs (such as the Elk&apos;s Club or a country club).

There are two important steps in forming a non-profit corporation:

1. Form a non-profit corporation in your home state.
2. Adopt bylaws for the corporation and obtain an employer identification number.

Once these steps are completed, the non-profit corporation must submit an application to the IRS requesting tax exempt status under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3).

A 501(c)(3) public charity is an organization that (1.) has been organized under state law, (2.) is operated for a 501(c)(3) purpose, (3.) benefits an unidentified charitable class of people (e.g. patients suffering from a specific disease), (4.) engages in activities that are non-political in nature and (5.) derives at least one-third of its support from the general public. A 501(c)(3) purpose includes?but is not limited to?educational, religious, scientific, medical and charitable endeavors.

The 501(c)(3) submission process typically takes 3-6 months, provided the application is properly prepared and all the procedural requirements have been met.

For your convenience, I have provided additional information and links to begin your non-profit formation:
