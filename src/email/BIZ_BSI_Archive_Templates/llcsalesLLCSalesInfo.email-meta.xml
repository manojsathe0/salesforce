    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.

A Limited Liability Company, or LLC, is an entity created under state laws, which has characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Like a corporation, the owners of an LLC are not personally liable for the debts of the LLC. Like a partnership and sole proprietorship, an LLC is easier to manage than a corporation.  It also acts as a pass-through entity for tax purposes meaning that the profits of the LLC are passed through and taxable to the owners of the LLC.

For your convenience, I have provided additional information and links to begin your LLC formation:

I recommend the Express Gold Package because it offers significant benefits. The Gold Package includes free preparation of your Tax ID application (for easy self-filing) OR a {!snippetVariable.ein_prep} discount toward LegalZoom&apos;s complete Tax ID Obtainment Service. Most importantly, it will expedite your filing process, reducing the waiting period to 7-10 business days. Other packages take 20-35 business days.

Also, you may want to consider using LegalZoom&apos;s Registered Agent Service. Setting up a registered agent is a state requirement for all LLCs. LegalZoom&apos;s Registered Agent Service ensures professional handling of your company&apos;s state correspondence and also helps ensure your privacy. We offer Registered Agent Services at an affordable rate of {!snippetVariable.ra_annual} per year.

If you have any further questions, please simply reply to this email, or feel free to call us toll-free at $biz_phone $biz_hours.

Best regards,
