    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.

DBA stands for ?doing business as? (also known as a ?fictitious business name,? ?trade name? or ?assumed name? in some jurisdictions). 

DBA registration is necessary if your business operates under a name other than its legal name. The legal name of a corporation, LLC, or other state registered entity is the name on the articles filed with the state.  For businesses that have not registered as a corporation or LLC, the legal name is the personal name of the business owner or owners.

Conducting business and opening a bank account under a name other than the legal name of your business is only possible after you have fulfilled your state?s DBA filing requirement.

For your convenience, I have provided additional information and links to begin your DBA Registration:
