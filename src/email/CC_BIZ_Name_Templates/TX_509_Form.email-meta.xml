    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry. In a recent phone call you indicated your desire to resolve the conflict with the proposed name of your new business by filing Texas Secretary of State Form 509 entitled “Consent to Use of Similar Name”. To do so,, you will need to obtain a consent from:

[Company name]

This company’s listed contact info is:

[RA address]

When requesting consent to use your entity name, a few key steps are needed:
•	Complete the 509 Form as follows:
o	Item 1: Enter the name of the entity or individual who holds the existing name.

•	Execution: Form 509 must be signed in the presence of a notary public.  The form must be signed by the person who holds the rights to the existing name, or someone authorized to act on the individual’s behalf.  If the existing name is held by an entity, an individual who is authorized to act on behalf of the entity must sign the form. Please see attached sample.
