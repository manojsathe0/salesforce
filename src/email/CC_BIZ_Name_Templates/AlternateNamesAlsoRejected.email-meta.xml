    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Thank you for your inquiry.

Based on the preliminary name check we have performed on your behalf, it appears that the alternate name choices are not available. To prevent delays, please provide a minimum of three alternate name choices so that we may proceed with the order. If we should require anything further a Specialist will contact you directly.
