    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Thank you for your inquiry.

Typically, LegalZoom performs the entity name search within 1-2 business days from the date the order is placed. The name search is generally performed via the State&apos;s website, by telephone or email, depending on the requirements of the filing state. Once the name has been preliminarily cleared as an available name, LegalZoom.com will prepare the documents and submit to the State for filing.  

Please keep in mind that the business name should only be used after the State has officially approved and filed the entity. An email notification will be sent once we receive the filed documents from the State.
