    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry.

When filing for a DBA/Business Name in New York, in many counties there are specific rules regarding what business names are allowed. The rule that typically causes the most trouble is the requirement for names to be composed of actual words that can be found in an English dictionary. If proper names are to be used, they typically have to be a name of one of the partners in the filing. If an acronym is to be used in a business name, it is also required to be the initials of one of the partners involved. 

Though this definitely can limit naming possibilities, generally the filing process will go smoothly as long as these rules are complied with.
