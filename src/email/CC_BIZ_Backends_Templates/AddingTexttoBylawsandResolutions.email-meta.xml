    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry.

If you would like to add any specific text to your bylaws and resolutions, we will be happy to add it for you, or you can also make the revisions yourself. 

Additions or revisions can be made in the bylaws and resolutions directly, or by adding an amendment to the document, and signing it into effect. However, LegalZoom cannot evaluate or advise you on the content of the text you add or revise.

If you would like to have us add the text for you, please call our ordering department at 888.381.8758 for pricing, or you may reply to this email with interest for that service, and the ordering department will reply to you directly with more information.
