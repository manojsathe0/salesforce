Your application indicates that your Trademark is to be filed under an &#8220;Intent to Use&#8221; filing basis with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Under an &#34;Intent to Use&#34; filing basis, a specimen is not required.<br/><br/>Applicants may apply for a Trademark under one of two types of filing basis (&#8220;Intent to Use&#8221; or &#8220;Used in Commerce&#8221;).<br/>Under an &#8220;Intent to Use&#8221; filing basis, the applicant has not used his/her mark in connection with the goods and/or services listed on his/her application. Under &#8220;Intent to Use&#8221; filing basis, a specimen is not required.<br/><br/>Under a &#8220;Used in Commerce&#8221; filing basis, the applicant is currently using his/her mark in connection with the goods and/or services listed on his/her application. If a &#8220;Used in Commerce&#8221; filing basis is selected, the following information is necessary to proceed:<br/><br/>1. A specimen. A specimen that demonstrates how the mark is being used in commerce for every classification of goods and services included on your application. A specimen is not just a picture of your Trademark or logo. Instead, a specimen is a real world example of how your mark is currently being used in commerce.<br/><br/>For services, acceptable specimens include brochures, flyers, advertisements, yellow page listings and internet websites. Business cards or stationery are usually not acceptable. For goods (products), acceptable specimens include labels or tags attached to the product, packaging material, instruction manuals and containers which display the Trademark.<br/><br/>
