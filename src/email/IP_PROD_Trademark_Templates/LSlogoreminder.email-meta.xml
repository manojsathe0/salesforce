    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

As a reminder, we require that you submit a sample of your logo to complete your Trademark order. Please note that only one logo can be submitted per application, and should be in black-and-white.  A black and white sample allows your logo to be protected without limiting the colors that can be used with or within it. A color sample, on the other hand, limits your Trademark to the specific colors used, and must be accompanied by a “color claim,” listing the colors you want to limit yourself to, and stating where on your logo you use each color.

If you wish to protect only the words of your Trademark and therefore file a TYPED FORMAT application instead, please reply to this email and indicate that you want to make this change. For more information, go here.

----------------------------------

SUBMITTING YOUR LOGO:

Please reply to this e-mail and attach your logo sample, preferably in .jpg, .jpeg, .gif or .pdf format. Email attachments cannot exceed 6MB.

If you are using a Mac computer or your attachments are larger than 6MB combined, please upload your image(s) directly here.

Or, if you prefer, you can mail us your materials.  Our mailing address is:

{!snippetVariable.ip_address_tm_materials} 

Please note: LegalZoom will not share your materials with any third party unless necessary for the completion of your order.  Furthermore, LegalZoom does not retain physical copies of your submissions, and will not be held responsible for returning those materials to you.

----------------------------------

If you have any questions or would like additional information, simply reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 6 a.m.–7 p.m. PT.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
