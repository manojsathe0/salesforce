    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for using LegalZoom.

The total you&apos;ve paid is inclusive of the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) filing and LegalZoom processing fees. Refunds are not applicable for applicants who are eligible for the TEAS Plus form.

Please note that the USPTO provides 2 separate forms for filing Trademarks, the TEAS Plus ($275 per class) and TEAS ($325 per class). If specific requirements cannot be met, the TEAS form is filed. The type of form used will not necessarily affect your application process with the USPTO. Additionally, if the TEAS Plus form is submitted and the examiner does not find that it meets certain requirements, they will request an additional $50 to change the application to follow TEAS requirements. If this issue arises for your application, the said charges will be covered by LegalZoom. In general, the type of form cannot be determined until the end of the filing process. Therefore, to allow up-front pricing, all LegalZoom customers are charged the full price of filing.
