The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires a specific list of products (goods) and services for your trademark. These descriptions are important, as they are used to categorize each trademark within specific international classifications. <a href=http://www.legalzoom.com/trademarks-faq/how-to-list-products-services-on-trademark-application.html>Click here</a> to see examples. <p>

Your current description reads:<br/><br/>

[enter customer description]<br/><br/>

Below are some examples of acceptable descriptions that can be used for your application:<br/><br/>
 
[enter descriptions here]<br/><br/>
 
You can also <a href=http://tess2.uspto.gov/netahtml/tidm.html>click here</a> to view the USPTO's complete list of acceptable descriptions for products and services. To use this tool, please enter specific keywords (i.e. "clothing" or "retail store") and a listing of descriptions will appear with appropriate class numbers. You can use any of the descriptions displayed that are applicable to your trademark. <b>NOTE: You have paid for one class--each additional class will require a <font color="red">$XXX</font> fee.<br/><br/></b>
 
Because LegalZoom is legally prohibited from giving legal advice, it is our customers' responsibility to develop a description that is appropriate for their trademark.*  Although inadequate descriptions are often able to be amended after a trademark application has been filed, the scope of the description cannot be broadened. Such amendments may also delay the registration process.  Once a trademark application is filed, LegalZoom will not file amendments on behalf of the applicant.<br/><br/> 

After reviewing the information provided by the USPTO, please reply to this email and provide us with a detailed list of products and services.<br/><br/>

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon. <br/><br/>

Best regards,<br/><br/>

The LegalZoom Team <br/><br/>
