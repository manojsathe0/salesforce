    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for using LegalZoom.

Office Actions are direct correspondences from the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and are generally either requesting additional information and/or updating you on the status of your application.

If you have installed Anti-Spam filters or software on your email service, please ensure that legitimate emails from TEAS@uspto.gov is not falsely identified as spam or junk. If you wish to view and/or download your application information and correspondences from the USPTO, please visit here.

Because LegalZoom is not a law firm, we are unable to provide legal advice. Although we assisted in the filing of your Trademark application, we are not your attorney. If you need to file a response, please review the bottom of your Office Action for further instructions. Otherwise, you may contact the USPTO Assistance Center at 800-786-9199 or call your examining attorney: xxxx at (xxx) xxx-xxxx.

If you need to petition a refusal or require legal advice, you may use our attorney locator services to contact a Trademark attorney here.
