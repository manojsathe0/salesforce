    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for using LegalZoom.

We have received your logo; however, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires that the logo be completely identical to the literal element listed in the application.  No additional words, letters or punctuation marks may appear on your logo if they are not listed on the application.  

Your literal element as specified on LegalZoom&apos;s preliminary application was left blank.  However, the logo you sent us contains the standard text or characters of &quot;XXXXXX&quot;.  
 
To resolve this issue, please reply to this email and select ONE of the following options:  
 
1.  Submit a different logo that has no literal element as specified on the application, or...   
2.  Amend the application to have a literal element of &quot;XXXXXXX&quot;
3.  Submit the logo and literal element as is. During examination of your application, if your assigned examining attorney raises questions regarding this matter, the applicant will be responsible for responding to the request with the appropriate information.

To read more about the literal element, visit: http://legalzoom.force.com/LZPKB/articles/Answer/2396

If you proceed without a literal element and would like to have an optional design search conducted for $250, please call us to submit payment for the additional fee. Otherwise, we can continue without the preliminary search.
 
With this in mind, please reply to this email and indicate how you would like to proceed with your application. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}.  Our Customer Care business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.

Best regards,

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}
