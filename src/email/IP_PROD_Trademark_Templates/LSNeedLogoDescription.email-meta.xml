    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for using LegalZoom.

We are currently processing your Trademark application, however, we are missing some vital information that is needed to complete the application process.

Please reply with a description of the stylized mark, even if what the mark represents is immediately clear, e.g., &quot;The letter C&quot;.  Also, for any color mark, the description of the mark must include the nature and location of the color; e.g., &quot;A bird with a red body, blue wings, and yellow beak.&quot; ***Please note, however, that most applications are submitted in black-and-white, and do not require a color description.***

Please feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.

Thank you again for choosing LegalZoom.

Best regards,

LegalZoom {!snippetVariable.ipdtm_dept_full}
