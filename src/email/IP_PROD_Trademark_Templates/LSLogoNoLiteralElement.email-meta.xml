    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for using LegalZoom.

We have received your logo; however, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires that the logo be completely identical to the literal element listed in the application. No additional words, letters or punctuation marks may appear on your application if they are not listed on the logo. Your literal element as specified on LegalZoom&apos;s preliminary application is &quot;XXXXXXXXX&quot;. However, the black-and-white logo you sent us does not contain any standard text or characters.

To resolve this issue, please reply to this email and select ONE of the following options:

1. Submit a different logo that matches the literal element as specified on the application
2. Amend the application to no longer have a literal element
3. Submit the logo and literal element as is. During examination of your application, if your assigned examining attorney raises questions regarding this matter, the applicant will be responsible for responding to the request with the appropriate information.

To view more information about the literal element, please visit: http://legalzoom.force.com/LZPKB/articles/Answer/2396

If you proceed without a literal element and would like to have an optional design search conducted for $250, please call us to submit payment for the additional fee. Otherwise, we can continue without the preliminary search.

With this in mind, please reply to this email and indicate how you would like to proceed with your application.

Please feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.
