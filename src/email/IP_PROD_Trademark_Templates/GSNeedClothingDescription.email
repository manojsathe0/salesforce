Dear {!Contact.FirstName},<br/><br/>

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires a specific list of products ("goods") and services for your trademark. This description is required for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to identify and assign an international classification number to your application.  <br/><br/>Your current description reads: XXXXXXXXXXX<br/><br/>In general, the USPTO requires a list of specific clothing articles being provided (or planning to provide for &#34;intent to use&#34; applications). An example of a specific description includes &#34;Clothing, namely hats, t-shirts, sweatshirts&#34;.<br/><br/>Please visit {!snippetVariable.tm_gs_manual} to view additional descriptions accepted by the USPTO. To view all descriptions listed under the clothing classification, please enter &#34;025[IC]&#34; and a full listing of descriptions will appear. You may adopt multiple descriptions from this list if applicable. <br/><br/>When completed, please email us with your description in the following format:<br/>&#8220;Clothing, namely, ________, ________, and ________.&#8221; <br/><br/>NOTE: You have paid for one class&#8212;each additional class will require a <font color="red">$XXX</font> fee.<br/> <br/>

Because LegalZoom cannot provide legal advice, it is your responsibility to develop a description that is appropriate for your application.* Although inadequate descriptions can sometimes be amended after a Trademark application has been filed, the scope of the description cannot be expanded. Such amendments may also delay the registration process. 

<br/><br/>

For more information relating to goods and services, as well as International Classifications, please visit {!snippetVariable.tm_resources_guides}<br/><br/> 

{!snippetVariable.ip_gs_closing}<br/><br/>


We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon. <br/><br/>

Best regards,<br/><br/>The LegalZoom Team<br/><br/>
