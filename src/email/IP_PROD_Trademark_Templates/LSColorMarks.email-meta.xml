    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

In general, Trademark applications are submitted in black and white unless specifically directed by the customer to apply for a color mark. This allows the design to be protected without limiting the colors which can be used. However, if you do not plan on ever changing the colors and wish to claim specific colors to your mark, we can file color mark application. We will need you to resend the color logo and provide the following information:

(1) A color claim naming the colors that are a feature of the mark; and (2) a separate statement describing where the color(s) appear on the mark. A color drawing will not publish without both of these statements.

A properly worded color claim would read as follows:

The color(s) &lt;name the color(s)&gt; are claimed as a distinctive feature of the mark.
A properly worded description would read as follows:
The color(s) &lt;name the color(s)&gt; appear in &lt;specify portion of mark on which color(s) appear&gt;.

If the color claim or description is unclear or ambiguous, the examining attorney must require clarification. The applicant may supplement the required written description of the color contained in a mark with a reference to a commercial color identification system. The Office does not endorse or recommend any one commercial color identification system. The written description of the mark must include a generic description of the color, in addition to the reference to the commercial color identification system.
