<p>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, </p>

<p>
(Option1: Black and White - Select this paragraph if sample is Black and White and delete Color)
</p>
<p>
In order to process your trademark application, we need a sample of your final logo to submit to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Only one logo can be submitted per application, and it should be in <b>black and white</b>. A black and white sample allows your logo to be protected without limiting the colors that can be used with or within it. If you do not have a true black and white sample of your logo, send us a color version instead and authorize us to convert it to black and white for you.
</p>
<p>
(Option 2: Color - Select this paragraph if sample is Color and delete Black and White)
</p>
<p>
In order to process your trademark application, we need a sample of your final logo to submit to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Only one logo can be submitted per application, and it should be in <b>color</b>, since color is being claimed as a feature of your mark. A color sample limits your trademark to the specific colors used and must be accompanied by what’s called a “color claim.” Do not submit a black and white sample.
