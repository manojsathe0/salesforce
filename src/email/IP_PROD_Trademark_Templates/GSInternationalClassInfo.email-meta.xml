    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

An International Classification Number will be assigned to your description of products (&quot;goods&quot;) and services by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).

If the class number is not entered on your Trademark application, they will assign a number during their initial review of your application and description.  Also, if a class number is entered and the USPTO later determines that the number is incorrect, an Office Action will be issued, requesting you to revise the classification number.

Please note: Although named &quot;international&quot; class, this application is only for protection in the U.S.; the word &quot;international&quot; is used only in the context of the worldwide classification system of which the USPTO is a part of. To view the USPTO&apos;s list of classes, please visit {!snippetVariable.tm_gs_classes_list}

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
