    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We have prepared your materials and are working on finalizing your Trademark Application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). You should expect to receive a time-sensitive email within three business days from LegalZoom requesting your electronic signature (e-signature) for the application.

Please review the application thoroughly before signing. An e-signature has the same validity as a pen-and-ink signature but is completed online. To view your application and complete the electronic signature, follow the &quot;Click Here&quot; link at the bottom of the email. Detailed instructions for completing the e-signature can be found here. Once your application has been signed, many aspects cannot be changed or modified in any way, and all application fees are non-refundable.

Upon receipt of your completed e-signature, LegalZoom will complete your order by paying the required filing fee(s). You will receive a confirmation email which will include your USPTO serial number, which allows you to track the status of your application online (http://tarr.uspto.gov). Please allow up to 3 weeks before checking the status.

The USPTO should assign the Trademark application to an examiner within 6-8 months. The complete registration process typically takes 8-13 months, but in some cases can take longer. While you can use the TM or SM symbol at anytime, the circle R (R) symbol should not be used until the mark is fully registered.

Please feel free to contact our Customer Care Team if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at 1.800.773.0888. Our Customer Care Team business hours are Monday through Friday, 6:00am to 7:00pm Pacific Time.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
