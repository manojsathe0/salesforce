    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom!

We have made several attempts to contact you regarding your Trademark application. However, because we had not received a sufficient response, your application has been processed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).

As indicated in our last email, if we have not received a response within 10 days, your application would be filed on your behalf. This email is to inform you that your Trademark application has been filed on your behalf today.

Please feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.
