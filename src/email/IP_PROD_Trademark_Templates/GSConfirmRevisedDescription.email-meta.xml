    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Per your request, your description of products (goods) and services has been revised. The description now reads as follows:

[Insert Goods and Services]

You will also be able to review your description before electronically signing your trademark application, which will be your last step with LegalZoom&apos;s process. Please note that once your application is submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), you cannot broaden or add to the scope of your products and services description.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
