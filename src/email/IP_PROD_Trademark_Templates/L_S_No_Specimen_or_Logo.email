Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 
</p>
We still have not received a sample of your logo and specimen to submit with your trademark application. Your order is currently on hold. If you would like us to continue processing your trademark application, we need you to submit two (2) items:
<ol>
<li>
(Option 1: black and white) <br>
<b>A sample of your logo</b>. Only one logo can be submitted per application, and it should be in <b>black and white</b>. A black and white sample allows your logo to be protected without limiting the colors that can be used with or within it. If you do not have a true black and white sample of your logo, send us a color version instead and authorize us to convert it to black and white for you.  
<br>
(Option 2: color) <br>
<b>A sample of your logo</b>. Only one logo can be submitted per application, and it should be in color, since color is being claimed as a feature of your mark. A color sample limits your trademark to the specific colors used and must be accompanied by what’s called a “color claim.” Do not submit a black and white sample.  
</li>
<li>
<b>Proof of use (called a "specimen")</b>For applications filed on a "use in commerce" basis, the USPTO requires proof that your proposed trademark is currently being used for the products and/or services listed on your application. The specimen you provide should be an actual, real-world example that clearly shows how the trademark is being used in connection with the products (“goods”) and/or services you listed in your application. Unlike your logo sample, your specimen can be in color without limiting the colors you can use with or within your trademark later.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
What are acceptable as specimens?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>For goods (products)</b>: Photos of labels or tags attached to the product, packaging material, instruction manuals and containers that display the mark. If you provide a website as your specimen for products, it must prominently feature your trademark near a picture or description of the products AND allow your customers to purchase through the site. A page that only advertises your products will generally not be accepted. <em>NOTE: Invoices, order forms, receipts, brochures, catalogs, press releases, business cards, and stationery are generally NOT acceptable specimens for products</em>
</li>
<li>
<b>For services</b>: A sign, brochure, advertisement, business card or a website (not under construction) prominently displaying your mark in connection with the services you’ve listed in your application. The specimen must include a reference to the service, not just the mark by itself. <em>NOTE: Printer’s proofs for advertisements or news articles about your services are generally NOT acceptable specimens for services.</em>
</li>
</ul>
