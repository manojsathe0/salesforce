    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

It came to our attention that you have listed LegalZoom on your Trademark application as the attorney on record with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Although we assisted in the filing of your Trademark application, we are not your attorney. To remove LegalZoom from your records as the representative attorney, please visit here.

If you require legal advice, you may use our attorney referral services to contact a Trademark attorney here.

Please feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.

Thank you again for choosing LegalZoom.

Best regards,

LegalZoom {!snippetVariable.ipdtm_dept_full}
