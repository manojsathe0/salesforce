    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for using LegalZoom.

Please note that an email has been sent to you, requesting your electronic signature for your Trademark Application form, the last step in the application process.  ***The e-signature must be completed in two weeks or the link will expire and a $25 reprocessing fee will be assessed.***  Please complete the following steps:

1.  Follow the &quot;Click Here&quot; link in the body of your email request.
2.  Review the information contained within the application.  If you would like to make a change to the application, please send a written request via email to trademarks@legalzoom.com.  
3.  Complete the electronic signature portion of the application.  Instructions are at the bottom of the form.

Once you have successfully signed your application, LegalZoom will prepare to submit it to the United States and Patent Office with the required payment. Shortly thereafter, a confirmation email will be sent to you with your assigned serial number for reference.
