  <td style="padding:15px 15px 15px 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:11.5px; line-height:17px; border:1px solid #CCCCCC;">Dear {!Contact.FirstName},<br/><br/>We have prepared your materials and are working on finalizing your Trademark Application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). You should expect to receive a time-sensitive email within three business days from LegalZoom requesting your electronic signature (e-signature) for the application.<br/><br/>Please review the application thoroughly before signing. An e-signature has the same validity as a pen-and-ink signature but is completed online. To view your application and complete the electronic signature, follow the &#34;Click Here&#34; link at the bottom of the email. Detailed instructions for completing the e-signature can be found <a href=http://legalzoom.force.com/LZPKB/articles/Answer/02059?retURL=%2Fapex%2FknowledgeHome&popup=false&lang=en_US>here</a>. Once your application has been signed, many aspects cannot be changed or modified in any way, and all application fees are non-refundable.<br/><br/>Upon receipt of your completed e-signature, LegalZoom will complete your order by paying the required filing fee(s). You will receive a confirmation email which will include your USPTO serial number, which allows you to track the status of your application online (http://tarr.uspto.gov). Please allow up to 3 weeks before checking the status.<br/> <br/>The USPTO should assign the Trademark application to an examiner within 6-8 months. The complete registration process typically takes 8-13 months, but in some cases can take longer. While you can use the TM or SM symbol at anytime, the circle R (R) symbol should not be used until the mark is fully registered.<br/><br/>Please feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.<br/><br/>We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.<br/><br/>Best regards,<br/><br/>The LegalZoom Team<br/></p></div>
