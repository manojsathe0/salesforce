<p>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},</p>

<p>Thank you for using LegalZoom.</p>

<p>Below you will find a link to your electronic trademark application form with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Click on the link to review your application for accuracy and complete the electronic signature on the bottom of the application (instructions for signing are provided after you click on the link). Please review your application as soon as possible – <b>Due to a USPTO update, all unfiled applications will expire on July 11th. If your application is not signed before July 10th by 12pm PST, a new one will need to be prepared. Please sign before this deadline to ensure your application is processed and filed timely. If you miss the deadline, please reply and we will provide you with a new application link.</b></p>

<p><b>How to sign?</b>: An electronic application is not signed in the traditional sense. The person authorized to sign the application verifies its content using a combination of alpha or numeric characters preceded and followed by the forward slash (/) symbol. Here’s an example of an electronic signature:  <b>/John Doe/</b>. You can find more information on electronic signatures in the yellow box within the application.</p>

<p><b>DO NOT SIGN THE APPLICATION IF YOU HAVE REVISIONS</b>. If you would like to make a change to the trademark application or to put your order on hold, please reply to this email as soon as possible.</p>

<p>To sign the Trademark/Service Mark Application, Principal Register electronically, please click the link below:</p>

<p>
 {!SignatureURL}
</p>

<p>NOTE: If your mail system does not allow such access directly, highlight the characters appearing in the URL address above and copy through your Edit function, then paste into your browser and click enter. If the link above appears on 2 separate lines, you must ensure that the entire address appears in the URL line of your browser (i.e., that both lines are copied and pasted to create one overall URL address) before clicking on enter.</p>
 
<p><b>Do not sign the application if you have revisions</b>. If you would like to make a change to the trademark application or to put your order on hold, please reply to this email within 14 days—if we do not hear from you, we may continue to file your application. The USPTO will then contact you directly to complete your signature and finalize the application.</p>


<p>If you have any questions or would like to request a change by phone, please feel free to call our Customer Care Team toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.</p>

<p>Otherwise, feel free to reply to this email.</p>

<p>Best regards,<br>
