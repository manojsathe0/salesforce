    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for using Legalzoom.

We are almost ready to file your Trademark application; however we are unable to continue processing the application because we are missing the Signatoryâ€™s Position.

The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires that all applications be signed by an individual with legal authority to bind the application. As part of this requirement, you must indicate the position or title of the signatory for this application.

Examples of acceptable position(s) include Owner, President, Vice President, Treasurer, Partner, Legal Guardian, or Attorney of Record. Examples of unacceptable descriptions include Self, Applicant, Employee, Friend, and Spouse. For more information, visit here: http://legalzoom.force.com/LZPKB/articles/Answer/02824?retURL=%2FLZPKB%2Fapex%2FknowledgeSearch%3Fc%3DAll_Products%26k%3Dsignatory%26lang%3Den_US&amp;popup=false&amp;lang=en_US

Please respond to this email with the following:

Name of the Authorized Signatory
Position and/or Title of Signatory

We will not be able to proceed with your application until this information is received.

Feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance.  Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}.  Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.
