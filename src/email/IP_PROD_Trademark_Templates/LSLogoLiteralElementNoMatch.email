Dear {!Contact.FirstName},<br/><br/>Thank you for using LegalZoom.<br/><br/>We have received your logo. However, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires that the literal element contained within the logo be completely identical to the literal element listed in the application. No additional words, letters or punctuation marks may appear on your logo if they are not listed on the application. Your literal element as specified on LegalZoom&#39;s preliminary application is &#34;XXXXXXXXX &#34;. However, the black-and-white logo you sent us displays the literal element &#34;XXXXXXXXX&#34;. <br/><br/>To resolve this issue, please reply to this email and select ONE of the following options: <br/><br/>1. Submit a different logo that matches the literal element as specified on the application <br/>2. Amend the application to match the literal element displayed on the current logo <br/>3. Submit the logo and literal element as is. During examination of your application, if your assigned examining attorney raises questions regarding this matter, the applicant will be responsible for responding to the request with the appropriate information.<br/><br/>
