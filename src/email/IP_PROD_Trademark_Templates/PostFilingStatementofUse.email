Although &#8220;Intent-to-Use&#8221; applications are a viable way to protect your mark before using it in commerce, the following will need to be submitted to the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) within 6 months of receiving your Notice of Allowance:
<ol>
<li>A Statement of Use: a sworn statement attesting to the use of the mark in commerce.
<li>$100 filing fee per class of goods or services.
<li>A specimen that demonstrates how the mark is being used in commerce for every classification of goods and services included on your application. A specimen is not just a picture of your Trademark or logo. Instead, a specimen is a real world example of how your mark is currently being used in commerce.
</ol>
<br/>
For services, acceptable specimens include brochures, flyers, advertisements, yellow page listings and internet websites. Business cards or stationery are usually not acceptable. For goods (products), acceptable specimens include labels or tags attached to the product, packaging material, instruction manuals and containers which display the Trademark.<br/><br/>You must file a Statement of Use within six (6) months of the mailing date stamped on the Notice of Allowance UNLESS, within that same period, you submit a request for a six-month extension of time to file the Statement of Use. You must file the request within six (6) months of the issue date of the Notice of Allowance, or previously granted extension period. You may request up to five (5) extensions of time. For more information on how to file a Statement of Use or extension, please visit <a href=http://www.uspto.gov/teas/eTEASpageB2.htm>here</a>.<br/><br/>LegalZoom can also help you file your Statement of Use form for a marginal cost.
