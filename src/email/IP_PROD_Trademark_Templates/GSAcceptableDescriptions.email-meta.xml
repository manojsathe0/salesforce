    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires a specific list of products (goods) and services for your trademark. These descriptions are important, as they are used to categorize each trademark within specific international classifications. Your current description reads:

[enter customer description]

Below are some examples of acceptable descriptions that can be used for your application:

[enter descriptions here]

Please visit {!snippetVariable.tm_gs_manual} to view the USPTO&apos;s complete list of acceptable descriptions for products and services. To use this tool, please enter specific keywords (i.e. &quot;clothing&quot; or &quot;retail store&quot;) and a listing of descriptions will appear with appropriate class numbers. You can use any of the descriptions displayed that are applicable to your trademark. NOTE: You have paid for one class--each additional class will require a $XXX fee.

PLEASE NOTE: You have paid for one class--each additional class will require a $385 fee.

Because LegalZoom is legally prohibited from giving legal advice, it is our customers&apos; responsibility to develop a description that is appropriate for their trademark*. Although inadequate descriptions are often able to be amended after a trademark application has been filed, the scope of the description cannot be broadened. Such amendments may also delay the registration process. Once a trademark application is filed, LegalZoom will not file amendments on behalf of the applicant.

After reviewing the information provided by the USPTO, please provide us with a detailed list of goods and services.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
