    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom. We received your inquiry about the pricing of the LegalZoom Trademark Package and wanted to address your questions.

Our Trademark application pricing varies by state. In some states, we are able to offer 2 packages – a Basic Package for $169 and a Complete Coverage Package for $189 which includes access to our Business Advantage Pro service. In states where we do not offer the Business Advantage Pro service, we offer 3 LegalZoom Trademark Packages – a Standard Package for $169, a Plus Package for $289, and a Gold Package for $389. Note: The pricing listed does not include the government filing fee. Each package will require a government filing fee of at least $325 to be paid at or prior to LegalZoom’s filing of your Trademark application.

We understand your concern and assure you that we are working with all 50 states so that we can provide consistent offerings for all our customers.

Please feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.

Thank you again for choosing LegalZoom.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
