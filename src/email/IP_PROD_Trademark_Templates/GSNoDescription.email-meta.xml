    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

When reviewing your order, we noticed that you did not enter a description of the products (“goods”) and services for your Trademark application.  This description is required for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to identify and assign an international classification number to your application.  Examples include &quot;Apparel, namely hats, t-shirts, sweatshirts&quot; or &quot;a retail store selling [insert products sold here]&quot;. See More Examples

Because LegalZoom cannot provide legal advice, it is your responsibility to develop a description that is appropriate for your application.*  Although inadequate descriptions can sometimes be amended after a Trademark application has been filed, the scope of the description cannot be expanded.  Such amendments may also delay the registration process.

Please reply to this email with your description of products and services.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
