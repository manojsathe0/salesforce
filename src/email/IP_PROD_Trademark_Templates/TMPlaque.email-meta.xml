    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We regretfully do not offer plaque products at this time. Our supplier has discontinued their services and LegalZoom is currently researching other vendors. We apologize for the inconvenience.

A refund in the amount of $59.99 will be issued to the credit card on file for order XXXXXXX. Please allow 5-7 business days for this credit to be reflected onto your account.

Please feel free to contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} if we can be of further assistance.  Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}.  Our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} business hours are {!snippetVariable.cchours}.

Thank you again for choosing LegalZoom.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
