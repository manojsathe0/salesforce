    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires a specific description of your products (“goods”) and services to identify and assign an international classification number to your Trademark application.  Examples include &quot;Apparel, namely hats, t-shirts, sweatshirts&quot; or &quot;a retail store selling [insert products sold here]&quot;. See More Examples

Because LegalZoom cannot provide legal advice, it is your responsibility to develop a description that is appropriate for your application.*  Although inadequate descriptions can sometimes be amended after a Trademark application has been filed, the scope of the description cannot be expanded.  Such amendments may also delay the registration process.

Please reply to this email with a detailed list of products and services to be used on your Trademark application.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
