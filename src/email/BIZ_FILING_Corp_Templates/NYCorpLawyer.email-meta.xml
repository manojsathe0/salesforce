    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom for your incorporation order.  Due to the complexity of filing your corporation as a professional entity in New York, please review the following information.  

Filing as a professional corporation in New York requires 3 stages: (1) obtainment of Certificate of Good Standing, (2) file the Articles of Incorporation with the NY Secretary of State, and (3) submit certified copy of your Articles of Incorporation to your admitted Appellate Division.

In order to complete your order, please follow the steps listed below.

Steps to complete Stage 1:
•  You must obtain a Certificate of Good Standing from the Appellate Division of the Court in which you were admitted to.  The certificate must be less than one (1) year old.
•  Fax your Certificate of Good Standing to (323) 962-8300.  Please include your name and order number on the fax coversheet to ensure proper routing of your document to our processing team.
• Please note that we can obtain your Certificate of Good Standing for $30.00.  Please provide the time &amp; date of admission, as well as the Appellate Division to which you were admitted to.  Please reply to this email with the authorization to charge your credit card on file for the fee.
• In accordance with the NY state law, each shareholder and director of the corporation must be a licensed lawyer.  Please contact us if your corporation does not meet this requirement.  
• If you have additional shareholders or directors, we will also need the Certificate of Good Standing for each individual.  Each certificate must be less than one (1) year old.  You can fax the certificate(s) to (323) 962-8300.  Please include your name and order number on the fax coversheet to ensure proper routing of your document to our processing team.
•  Upon receipt of your Certificate of Good Standing, we will prepare and email the Articles of Incorporation for your signature.  We cannot prepare your Articles of Incorporation without the proper Certificate of Good Standing. 

If you have any questions regarding your order, please contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} at {!snippetVariable.ccphone} or customercare@legalzoom.com.  Please include your order number in your correspondences for prompt service.
