    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Your Trademark application has been filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. You should have received an email confirmation for your filing, which includes your assigned Trademark serial number.

You may check the status of your Trademark application on the USPTO website approximately 2 weeks after it was filed. Your serial number can be found within the confirmation email sent to you after your e-signature was completed.

Your application will be assigned to a Examining Attorney approximately three (3) months after it was submitted. The assigned attorney will contact you via phone, email, or regular mail should any changes or amendments be needed to prepare your Trademark for registration. The complete Trademark process typically takes about eight to thirteen months, but in some cases can take longer. Your Trademark registration is not complete until the USPTO issues you an official Registration Certificate. You are forbidden from using the “circle R” (®) symbol until the mark has officially been registered by the USPTO, however, you can use the letters TM or SM at any time.

Please check your email settings to ensure that legitimate emails from TEAS@uspto.gov are not falsely identified as spam or junk. If you wish to view and/or download your application information and correspondences from the USPTO, please visit the USPTO website.

Please feel free to contact our Customer Care Team if we can be of further assistance.  Simply reply to this email, or call us toll free at 1.800.773.0888. Our Customer Care Team is available Mon-Fri  5am to 7pm PT; Saturday  7am to 4pm PT.
