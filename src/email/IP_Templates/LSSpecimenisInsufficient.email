Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

<br/><br/>We have received your specimen to complete your trademark application; however, the materials received appear to be insufficient.<br/><br/>For applications filed on a &#34;Use in Commerce&#34; basis, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires proof that your proposed trademark is currently being used for the products and services on your application.<br/><br/>

******************For products****************** <br /><br />

If you are providing products, acceptable specimens include photographs of packaging labels, clothing tags or labels on containers that prominently display your Trademark. Invoices, order forms, receipts, brochures, catalogs, press releases, business cards, and stationery are generally NOT acceptable specimens for products.<br /><br />

<a href= http://www.legalzoom.com/trademarks-faq/what-is-a-trademark-specimen.html>See Examples</a> <br /><br />

******************For services****************** <br /><br />

If you are providing services, acceptable specimens include a sign, brochure, advertisement, business card, stationary or website prominently displaying your Trademark in connection with the services you’ve listed in your Trademark filing. The specimen must include a reference to the service, not just the Trademark by itself. Printer’s proofs for advertisements or news articles about your services are generally NOT acceptable specimens for services. <br /><br />
