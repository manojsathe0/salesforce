<p>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},</p>

<p>We still have not received a specimen of your trademark to submit with your trademark application. Your order is currently on hold. If you would like us to continue processing your trademark application, we will need to receive a specimen of your trademark.</p>

<p>Because you are applying to register a trademark on a “use in commerce” basis, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires that you provide proof of your use (called a “specimen”). The specimen you provide should be an actual, real-world example that clearly shows how the trademark is being used in connection with the products (“goods”) and/or services you listed in your application.</p>

<p>What are acceptable specimens:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>For goods (products)</b>: Photos of labels or tags attached to the product, packaging material, instruction manuals and containers that display the mark. If you provide a website as your specimen for products, it must prominently feature your trademark near a picture or description of the products AND allow your customers to purchase through the site. A page that only advertises your products will generally not be accepted. <em>NOTE: Invoices, order forms, receipts, brochures, catalogs, press releases, business cards, and stationery are generally NOT acceptable specimens for products</em>.</li>

<li><b>For services</b>: A sign, brochure, advertisement, business card or a website (not under construction) prominently displaying your mark in connection with the services you’ve listed in your application. The specimen must include a reference to the service, not just the mark by itself. <em>NOTE: Printer’s proofs for advertisements or news articles about your services are generally NOT acceptable specimens for services.</em></li>
</ul>
