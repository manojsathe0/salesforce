    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for submitting your specimen to LegalZoom. Unfortunately, the material(s) received appear to be insufficient.

For applications filed on a &quot;Use in Commerce&quot; basis, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)requires that applicants show sufficient proof that the Trademark is currently being used in the manner described within the list of goods and services.

******************For goods******************

For example, if a company has filed a Federal Trademark Application for &quot;Bob’s Shoes&quot; and listed &quot;shoes&quot; for its goods and services, they would need to submit a picture of a shoe box or pair of shoes that clearly demonstrated that its mark, &quot;Bob’s Shoes,&quot; was being offered in the marketplace.

A specimen is a real world example of how your mark is currently being used in commerce, and is more than just a picture of your Trademark or logo. ***Please note that your Trademark must stand out within the specimen. For example, if your Trademark is found within a body of text, it can be made distinctive by being bolder in text, in a larger or different font, or having a &quot;TM&quot; symbol following the mark.***

For goods (products), acceptable specimens include labels or tags attached to the product, packaging material, instruction manuals and containers which display the Trademark. ***Please note that websites, advertisements, brochures, business cards, catalogs and stationery are generally not acceptable specimens for goods (products).***

******************For services******************

For example, if a company has filed a Federal Trademark Application for &quot;Premier Investments&quot; and listed &quot;investment consultation&quot; for its goods and services, they would need to submit a website screenshot or brochure that clearly demonstrated that its mark, &quot;Premier Investments,&quot; was offering the described service.

A specimen is a real world example of how your mark is currently being used in commerce, and is more than just a picture of your Trademark or logo. ***Please note that your Trademark must stand out within the specimen. For example, if your Trademark is found within a body of text, it can be made distinctive by being bolder in text, in a larger or different font, or having a &quot;TM&quot; symbol following the mark.***

For services, acceptable specimens include brochures, flyers, advertisements, yellow page listings and internet websites. ***Please note that business cards and stationery are generally not acceptable specimens for services.***
