  <td style="padding:15px 15px 15px 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:11.5px; line-height:17px; border:1px solid #CCCCCC;">Dear {!Contact.FirstName},<br/><br/>Thank you for choosing LegalZoom.<br/><br/>Please confirm which format you wish to file your Trademark application under (&#8220;design&#8221; or &#8220;typed&#8221;).<br/> <br/>Marks in design format usually contain specific designs, pictures, artwork or fonts that the applicant wishes to protect. Under a design format, the mark will be protected only if it is used EXACTLY the way it appears on the logo that is provided to the USPTO. In other words, the applicant cannot change the font, position or style of the mark without losing protection rights.<br/> <br/>Trademark applications submitted in a typed format are filed solely to protect the mark&#8217;s wording, without claim to any designs or artwork. Marks filed in a typed format can be used and altered at the applicant&#8217;s discretion, so long as the words (the &#8220;literal element&#8221;) remain the same (and the alterations do not result in a mark that is likely to be confused with another entity&#8217;s mark). In other words, the applicant may use the mark in any font style or color, and maintain Trademark protection. Under a typed format, a copy of the logo is not needed.<br/><br/>Whether you decide to file your Trademark application under a design or typed format is entirely up to you. LegalZoom is not a law firm and cannot provide legal advice. We will provide general factual information and prepare the application in accordance with your directions.<br/><br/>With this is mind, please reply to this email and let us know how you would like us to proceed with your application.<br/><br/>
