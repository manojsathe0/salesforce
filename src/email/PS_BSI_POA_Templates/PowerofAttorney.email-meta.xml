    <textOnly>Dear Valued LegalZoom Customer,

Thank you for your recent inquiry.  In regards to your question, a Power of Attorney is a legal document that gives one person?s legal ?power? to another person(s). It is usually used to give one person the ability to make property, financial or other legal decisions on behalf of another person if certain events occur. LegalZoom offers three types of Power of Attorney documents for $35: Durable Power of Attorney, Non-Durable Power of Attorney, and Springing Power of Attorney.

? A Durable Power of Attorney takes effect immediately after it has been signed and notarized. It stays effective even if the person creating it becomes mental incapacitated, and continues to be effective until it is revoked or the person dies. 

? A Non-Durable Power of Attorney also take effect immediately after it has been signed and notarized, but stops if the person creating it becomes mentally incapacitated or revokes that power. 

? A Springing Power of Attorney takes effect only if a specific event happens. This event can be almost anything, including the mental incapacitation of the person creating the document. The document stays in effect until that person revokes it or he or she dies. 

I have included a complimentary ?Estate Planning Guide? to help you become more familiar with LegalZoom&apos;s documents.

Please call us toll-free at (800) 962-7490 if we can be of further assistance.  We look forward to hearing from you soon. 
 
Best regards,
