    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom for your real estate business needs. We have assisted thousands of customers in establishing and operating successful real estate businesses, and we would like to speak with you regarding the next steps for your business. These next steps are part of our Real Estate Investor program, and include a combination of state-required compliance matters as well as operational decisions to be made to ensure proper protection of your personal assets.

To begin this process, I have attached the first checklist with which we will be assisting you. You will have a dedicated Account Manager with whom you will be able to discuss these next steps. Your Account Manager will be your single point of contact at LegalZoom for managing your business needs.

Furthermore, your Account Manager will assist you with scheduling attorney and tax specialist consultations to help ensure that your business is sound from a legal and tax standpoint.

In addition to these next steps, your Account Manager will be able to assist you with additional matters including estate planning, deed transfer process, tax issues, managing tenants, and more.

Please contact me upon receiving this email so that I can put you in contact with your Account Manager. Thank you for choosing LegalZoom as your premiere business resource, and we look forward to assisting you in growing your business.

Best regards,

{!User.FirstName}
