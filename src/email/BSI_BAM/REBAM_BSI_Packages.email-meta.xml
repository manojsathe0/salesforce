    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom for your real estate business needs. In regard to our phone conversation, I have attached the options for our Real Estate Investor program. These options will assist you with multiple facets of running a successful real estate business, from handling tax and legal matters, to estate planning and compliance issues.

You will have a dedicated Account Manager with whom you will be able to discuss these options, as well as the next steps for your business. Your Account Manager will be your single point of contact at LegalZoom for managing your business needs.

Please contact me upon receiving this email so that I can put you in contact with your Account Manager. Thank you for choosing LegalZoom as your premiere business resource, and we look forward to assisting you in growing your business.


Best regards,
