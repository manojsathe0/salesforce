    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom for your [RETAIL/FOOD SERVICE] business needs.  In regard to our phone conversation, I have attached the options for our [RETAIL/FOOD SERVICE] program.  These options will assist you with multiple facets of running a successful [RETAIL/FOOD SERVICE] business, from handling tax and legal matters, to licensing and compliance issues.
