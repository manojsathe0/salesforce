    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry.

LegalZoom is not an attorney and cannot provide legal advice. However, we are always seeking innovative ways for people to get the benefits of the law. While we offer a wide variety of documents and services, people often need the advice and guidance of an attorney.

If you wish to find an attorney to answer your legal questions, please visit the link to our Attorney Connect national directory of pre-screened and insured attorneys at http://attorneyconnect.legalzoom.com/.
