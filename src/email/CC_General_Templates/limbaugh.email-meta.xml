    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

We&apos;ve listened to many concerns voiced from our LegalZoom team as well as our customers. As a result, we have pulled all advertising from the Rush Limbaugh Show. LegalZoom is a company that prides itself on respect for others, and we do not in any way support or endorse the recent comments made by Mr. Limbaugh.
