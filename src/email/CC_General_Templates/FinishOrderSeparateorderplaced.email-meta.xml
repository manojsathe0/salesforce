    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry. 

LegalZoom is currently processing the order you did complete and submit. The email you received regarding finishing an order is an automated email that refers to a separate order you may have looked into, but did not complete or submit. Any time a LegalZoom questionnaire is begun and not finished, an email is generated inviting the applicant to finish the process (in case their order was interrupted for whatever reason). You can disregard the automated email as the incomplete order will not process or be charged for unless you were to go through and complete that specific order.
