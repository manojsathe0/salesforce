    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry.

We do not have any comment on the Webster litigation resolved in 2011, except to say that we are confident we did not violate any laws. Be assured that there were no allegations in the litigation about the validity or quality of any documents you created using LegalZoom. The lawsuit and settlement did not affect your documents in any way. For further information on the Webster Class Action Notice, feel free to visit the settlement website here (www.Ldalitigation.com/).
