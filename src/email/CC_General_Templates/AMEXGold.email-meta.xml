    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry.

Over the past several years, LegalZoom has been exploring ways to assist our new customers in the development of their businesses. We&apos;ve found that the American Express OPEN Gold Card is an effective tool for saving money on common business expenses and quickly earning Membership Rewards Points -- the best rewards program we&apos;ve found.

To apply for the card, complete the application by clicking here:

Tip: The application does not require your Federal EIN. However, it is a good idea to update AMEX with this information, along with any changes to your corporation&apos;s name, when you have it.
