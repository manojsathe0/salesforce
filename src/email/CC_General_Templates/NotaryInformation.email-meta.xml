    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry.

The notarization of your document, like any other act that requires participation from a third party, is subject to acceptance of the task by the individual notary in question. Some notaries may be reluctant to notarize documents that they did not draft themselves. This is not a reflection upon the validity of your document, but an individual choice of that notary.

You can usually find a notary at a UPS store or similar packaging stores. Financial institutions such as banks also offer notary services. The Yellow Pages has lists of traveling notaries. Also, you can contact your city or county clerk to find a notary.  

Calling ahead to inquire about an individual notary&apos;s practice in such matters can save time and effort. For more information on notarization, {!snippetVariable.cs_notary_insert}.
