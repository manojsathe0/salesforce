    <subject>Manual Check for Old Order Refund</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I sincerely apologize but I am unable to process your refund back to your credit card due to the age of the charge.
 
Unfortunately, LegalZoom can only refund charges back to the credit card on file when the refund is requested within 6 months of purchase. Once this time has elapsed, your credit card information is no longer in our accounting system.  

As a result, we will need to issue your refund in the form of a manual check. Your check will be sent in the name of the account holder within 10-15 business days. Please confirm your address as:

[INSERT ADDRESS]
