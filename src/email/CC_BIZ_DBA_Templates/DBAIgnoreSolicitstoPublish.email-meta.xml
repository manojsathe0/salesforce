    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry.

Please disregard any solicitation of any kind regarding publication of your DBA name. This is something that happens automatically when your County files your documents. Legalzoom will submit your DBA for Publishing with a local County newspaper for 4 weeks, and verification will be provided to the County directly. Roughly 5-6 weeks after receiving your final completed package you will also receive proof of publication.
