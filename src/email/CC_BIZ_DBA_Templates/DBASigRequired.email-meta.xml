    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry.

The DBA package you purchased takes approximately 20-35 business days to process.  The specialist in charge of your filing sent you an e-mail on [Date Sent] requesting your signature on the documents.  This needs to be signed and sent back to LegalZoom in order for us to proceed with your filing.  If you have not received this important email, please contact us so it can be re-sent to you.
