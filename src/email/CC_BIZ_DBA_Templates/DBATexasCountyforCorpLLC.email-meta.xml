    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Thank you for your inquiry. 

When a DBA is filed for an LLC or Corporation in TX, in addition to filing the DBA with the State, the DBA must also be filed in the county where the entity&apos;s Registered Agent is located. In certain cases, the DBA must be registered in a third place, which is the county where the business will be conducted (if different from the county the Registered Agent is located in). 

The forms for your DBA were created according the information we have for your Registered Agent, however if this needs to be changed, or if the Registered Agent is not located in the county indicated on your forms, please let us know.
