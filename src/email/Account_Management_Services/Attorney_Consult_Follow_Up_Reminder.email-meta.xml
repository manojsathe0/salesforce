Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Following your consultation, the attorney sent us an email regarding changes to your trademark application order, but I have not been able to reach you to get your approval. Please contact me at your earliest convenience to confirm that you would like to make changes to your trademark application order. If you do not reply within five (5) business days, your trademark application will proceed as originally placed and will not include any changes.

Best Regards,
