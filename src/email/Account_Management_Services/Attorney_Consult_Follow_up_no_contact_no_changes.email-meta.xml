Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations on completing your attorney consultation. We received email notification from the attorney that you decided not to make any changes to your trademark application order. We will now proceed with the type of trademark search you selected.

I will reach out to you again before your trademark application is submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

Best Regards,
