    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

As part of your compliance package, we help ensure your required state filings are completed and filed on time.

The state of Alaska requires you to file a business license for your LLC within 30 days of your business being formed. Failure to file your documents on time may put your company at risk of late fees and dissolution.

Before we can complete your filings, we need additional information and payment for the state fees. The required state filings fees are listed below*.

Name of Filing - Fee to State of Alaska
Business License Application – $50
*Please note that state filing fees are subject to change without notice.

Please sign in to your LegalZoom account here and click the Completed Orders tab: https://www.legalzoom.com/LZWeb/MyAccount/ProductDetails.aspx?DeepLink=1. There you can access your compliance package and fill out the State Tax I.D. questionnaire.

Once you provide the necessary information and fees, we will file your forms with the state.  If you have already provided us with these items, please disregard this email.  This is your first email reminder of this state filing.  LegalZoom processing fees for this filing are included as long as you remain an active compliance member.

You can reach me at {!User.Phone}, {!User.Extension}, [***Input Business Hours HERE***].

We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.
