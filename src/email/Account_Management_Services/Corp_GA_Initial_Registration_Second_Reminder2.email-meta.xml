    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

As part of your compliance package, we help ensure your required state filings are completed and filed on time.

The state of Georgia requires you to file an initial annual registration for your corporation within 90 days of the business being formed. Please note that if your business was formed this year between October 2nd and December 31st, you may file your documents next year between January 1st to April 1st. Failure to file your initial annual registration on time may result in late fees.

Before we can complete your filings, we need additional information and payment for the state fees. The required state filings fees are listed below*.

Name of Filing: Initial Annual Registration 
Fee to State of Georgia: $50

*Please note that state filing fees are subject to change without notice.

Please sign in to your LegalZoom account here and click the Completed  Orders tab: https://www.legalzoom.com/LZWeb/Welcome/SignIn.aspx?TIMESTRING=&amp;iProcess=. There you can access your compliance package and fill out the Annual Report questionnaire.

Once you provide the necessary information and fees, we will file your forms with the state. If you have already provided us with these items, please disregard this email. This is your second email reminder of this state filing. LegalZoom processing fees for this filing are included as long as you remain an active compliance member.

You can reach me at {!User.Phone}, {!User.Extension}, [***Input Business Hours HERE***].
