Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

After conducting a name search, we have discovered that your requested [Entity Type] name choices are not available.

Please respond to me via email with three (3) other choices, in order of preference, or call me at (877) 808-1918 M-F, 9:00 AM – 6 PM PT. After I receive your reply, we will conduct another search to determine if the proposed names are available.

Please contact me at your earliest convenience to avoid any delays in your order. We are not able to file your documents with the Secretary of State unless your [Entity Type] name is available.

Best Regards,

[Account Manager] [ext.XXXX]
Account Management Services
T: 877-808-1918, M-F 9:00 am – 6 pm PT
