Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

It was a pleasure speaking with you about starting your business. As your dedicated Account Manager, I will be reaching out to you on a regular basis to provide you with the progress on your order and help answer any questions you may have.

Included in your [Product Type] order, you get unlimited 30-minute attorney and/or tax consultations on new matters. The more you know, the more power you have to build a business that is a lasting source of income and satisfaction. Don’t miss out on your benefits. Call me to schedule a consultation.

My direct number is 877-808-1918 [ext.XXXX].

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom.

Best Regards,

[Account Manager] [ext.XXXX]
