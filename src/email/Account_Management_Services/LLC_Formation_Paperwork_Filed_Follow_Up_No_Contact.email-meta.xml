Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Your LLC formation paperwork has been filed with the Secretary of State (or equivalent government office) in the state where you want to form your business. When the state government has completed the filing process, I will notify you and you will receive a final packet from LegalZoom that will help you get started with your business.

Please contact me at any time to learn more about the state filing process.

Best regards,
