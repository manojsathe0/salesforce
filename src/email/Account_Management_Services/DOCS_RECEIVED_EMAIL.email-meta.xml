Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Congratulations! We have received notice that your [Entity Type] documents have been accepted by the State. This means that you’ve formed your new business!  We are currently assembling your package and getting it ready to ship it to you. If you need your filed documents right away, respond to this email or call me at 877-808-1918, and I would be happy to email a copy to you.

Once the [Entity Type] is officially formed, many small business owners open a bank account, obtain local  business licenses, and create a website. If you have any questions or you want more information regarding any of these services, please contact me.

Best Regards,

[Account Manager] [ext.XXXX]
