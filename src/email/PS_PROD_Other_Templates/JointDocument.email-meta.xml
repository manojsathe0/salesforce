    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We are writing to notify you that your recent order for a [DOC TYPE] is on hold. As soon as you contact us to clarify the following problem, we can complete your order.

To correct this problem, please contact me or log back into www.legalzoom.com with your username and password and reopen order #XXXXXX to assign just one individual to the document.

If you have any additional questions, simply reply to this email or call us toll-free at 1-888-821-7574. We appreciate your business and look forward to serving your future legal document needs.
