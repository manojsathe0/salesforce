    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We are writing to notify you that your recent order for a Last Will and Testament is on hold. As soon as you contact us to clarify the following problem, we can complete your order.

This document requires 100% of your Estate be accounted for in the Principal Distribution and Alternate Principal Heirs Clauses. These sections distribute your property as percentages of your overall Estate.  Currently, your document does not account for a full 100% of your Estate.  

To correct this problem, please contact me or log back into www.legalzoom.com with your username and password and reopen order #XXXXXXXX to adjust the percentages distributed to each beneficiary to total exactly 100%.

If you have any additional questions, simply reply to this email or call us toll-free at 1-888-821-7574.  We appreciate your business and look forward to serving your future legal document needs.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
