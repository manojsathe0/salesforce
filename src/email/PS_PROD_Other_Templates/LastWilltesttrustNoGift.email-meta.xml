    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We are writing to notify you that your recent order for a Last Will and Testament is on hold. As soon as you contact us to clarify the following problem, we can complete your order.

Currently, you have named XXXXXXXX to be the beneficiary(s) of your Testamentary Trust. A Testamentary Trust puts aside a share of your Estate that you?ve gifted to a beneficiary (usually a minor or child) and is managed by someone of your choosing (usually a named guardian or other responsible adult) until your condition is satisfied. Then, the inheritance transfers entirely. 

However, the Testamentary Trust Beneficiary, XXXXXXX, is not listed as an Heir, Alternate Heir, or otherwise named to receive any specific gifts under your Last Will and Testament. 

To correct this problem, please contact me or log back into www.legalzoom.com with your username and password and reopen order #XXXXXXXX to list the beneficiary as an heir, alternate heir or as someone who will receive a specific gift of property.

If you have any additional questions, simply reply to this email or call us toll-free at 1-888-821-7574.  We appreciate your business and look forward to serving your future legal document needs.

Best regards, 

The LegalZoom Team
