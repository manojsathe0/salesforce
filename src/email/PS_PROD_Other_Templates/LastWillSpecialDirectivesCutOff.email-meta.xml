    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We are writing to notify you that your recent order for a Last Will and Testament is on hold. As soon as you contact us to clarify the following problem, we can complete your order.

Due to a character limitation in our questionnaire, your Special Directives were cut off.  Below are your Special Directives to the point where they were cut off:

&quot;[PASTE SPECIAL DIRECTIVES]&quot;

To correct this problem, please contact me with the remainder of your Special Directives.  

If you have any additional questions, simply reply to this email or call us toll-free at 1-888-821-7574.  We appreciate your business and look forward to serving your future legal document needs.

Best regards, 

The LegalZoom Team
