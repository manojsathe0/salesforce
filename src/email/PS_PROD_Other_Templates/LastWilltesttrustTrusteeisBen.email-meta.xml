    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
We are writing to notify you that your recent order for a Last Will and Testament is on hold. As soon as you contact us to clarify the following problem, we can complete your order.

You have chosen to include a Testamentary Trust.  A Trust puts aside a share of your Estate for a person (usually a minor) and is managed until your condition is satisfied.  Then, the inheritance transfers in its entirety. 

However, you have listed the Testamentary Trust?s beneficiary and its trustee as the same person.  The Trustee is the person who will manage the trust while the Trust Beneficiary is the person who will eventually receive the trust. 

To correct this problem, please contact me or log back into www.legalzoom.com with your username and password and reopen order #XXXXXXXX to provide the name of a new Trustee and/or Trust Beneficiary.  You may also name an alternate trustee. *Remember, a Trust Beneficiary must also be named in your Will as receiving an inheritance either as a general percentage or via a specific gift in order for the Trust to function properly.

If you have any additional questions, simply reply to this email or call us toll-free at 1-888-821-7574.  We appreciate your business and look forward to serving your future legal document needs.

Best regards, 

The LegalZoom Team
