    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We are writing to notify you that your recent order for a Last Will and Testament is on hold. As soon as you contact us to clarify the following problem, we can complete your order.

Currently, you have not named an Executor for your Will, and you need to select at least one.  The Executor will serve as your personal representative and will be responsible for carrying out the intentions in your Will. 

To correct this problem, please contact me or log back into www.legalzoom.com with your username and password and reopen order #XXXXXXXX to provide the name and relation of your chosen Executor.  You can also name up to 2 alternates.

If you have any additional questions, simply reply to this email or call us toll-free at 1-888-821-7574.  We appreciate your business and look forward to serving your future legal document needs.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
