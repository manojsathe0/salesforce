    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We are writing to notify you that your recent order for a Last Will and Testament is on hold. As soon as you contact us to clarify the following problem, we can complete your order.

In the Pet Trust Clause, any money you leave for the care of your pet(s) must be expressed as a specific lump sum.  In your current document, a specific lump sum is not provided.

Examples of pet trust provisions which are beyond the scope of our document and therefore cannot be accommodated include:

1. $100.00 per month or per year
2. 10% of my Estate
3. An amount to be decided on later by a third party

To correct this problem, please contact me or log back into www.legalzoom.com with your username and password and reopen order #XXXXXXXX to name one lump sum for your Pet Trust Clause.

If you have any additional questions, simply reply to this email or call us toll-free at 1-888-821-7574.  We appreciate your business and look forward to serving your future legal document needs.

Best regards, 

The LegalZoom Team
