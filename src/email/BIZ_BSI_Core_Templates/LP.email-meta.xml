    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business services needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist in creating a Limited Partnership (LP) on your behalf.  

A Limited Partnership (LP) is a business entity that is comprised of at least two partners: a General Partner and a Limited Partner.  Liability protection is provided only to Limited Partners, who are also commonly known as silent investors.  General Partners are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the LP and therefore assume the liabilities incurred within the business.  A business entity, such as a Corporation or an LLC, may be designated as a partner of an LP. 

For your reference, I have provided the fees and links to our Limited Partnership formation services below:
