    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business services needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can register a DBA (Doing Business As) name in the state of your choice.  LegalZoom will make the process easy for you by preparing the DBA Application and filing it on your behalf, as well as taking care of any publication requirements if needed.  

A DBA (trade name or fictitious business name) is a name registration that allows you to conduct business under a name that is different from your legal name.  With a DBA you will be able to obtain a Federal Tax Identification Number (FEIN), open a business bank account, and accept or write checks under the business name.  [Please note that a DBA does not offer liability protection to its owner(s), and in most states the DBA does not provide name exclusivity.] 

For your reference, I have provided the fee and links to our DBA service below:
