    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business services needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist in creating a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) on your behalf.  

A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is a business entity that is typically formed by licensed professionals depending on the State of formation.  An LLP is comprised of at least two partners.  Generally, partners in an LLP are not responsible for another partner&apos;s debts, obligations, or liabilities.  LLPs differ from LPs in that liability protection is granted to all partners. 

For your reference, I have provided the fees and links to our Limited Liability Partnership formation services below:

LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNERSHIP
Economy Package | $149.00 + state fee + shipping (20 - 35 business days)
Standard Package | $259.00 + state fee + shipping (20 - 35 business days)

OPTIONAL SERVICES
Federal Tax Identification Number (FEIN) Application Preparation | $30.00 (Included in Express Gold Package)
FEIN Obtainment | $79.00 ($49.00 with Express Gold Package)

Registered Agent Service | $159.00 for the first year
