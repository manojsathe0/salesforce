    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business services needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in creating a Corporation in the state of your choice.  We will make the process easy for you by preparing the Articles of Incorporation and filing it with your respective Secretary of State. LegalZoom will also draft a customized, state-specific corporate bylaws and resolutions which allows the corproation to govern itself and including important information such as ownership and banking resolutions.

A Corporation is a state-specific business entity that provides its owners with personal liability protection, keeping business assets and personal assets separate.  In the event of a business lawsuit or bankruptcy, the owners of a Corporation are not personally responsible for any debts or liabilities incurred by the business.  The Corporation will allow you to obtain a Federal Tax Identification Number (FEIN), open a business bank account, hire employees, and own property under the business name.  The Corporation also provides name exclusivity in the state in which it is registered. 

For your reference, I have provided the fees and links to our Incorporation service below:
