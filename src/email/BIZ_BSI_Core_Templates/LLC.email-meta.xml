    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business services needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in creating a Limited Liability Company (LLC) in the state of your choice.  We will make the process easy for you by preparing the Articles of Organization and filing it with your respective Secretary of State.  LegalZoom will also draft a customized, state-specific Operating Agreement, which helps to protect your personal assets from liabilty and includes management provisions and ownership information.

An LLC is a state-specific business entity that provides its owners with personal liability protection, keeping business assets and personal assets separate.  In the event of a business lawsuit or bankruptcy, the owners of an LLC are not personally responsible for any debts or liabilities incurred by the business.  The LLC will allow you to obtain a Federal Tax Identification Number (FEIN), open a business bank account, hire employees, and own property under the business name.  The LLC also provides name exclusivity in the state in which it is registered. 

For your reference, I have provided the fees and links to our LLC service below:

Economy Package | $99.00 + state fee + shipping (20 - 35 business days)
Standard Package | $289.00 + state fee + shipping (20 - 35 business days)
