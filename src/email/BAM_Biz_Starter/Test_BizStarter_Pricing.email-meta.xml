The Registered Agent Service is another optional service that may be added to any package for an annual fee of $159.00. Please keep in mind that this service is charged only after the LLC is filed.

Finally, payment of the package you choose may be split into 3 monthly installments, and doing so will not affect the turnaround time.

As always, please don&apos;t hesitate to contact me with any questions you may have, or when you are ready to proceed. You can call me at (855) 787-1921 Monday–Friday from 8 a.m.–5 p.m. PT or email me anytime at BizHelp@legalzoom.com
