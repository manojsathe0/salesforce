    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you again for giving me the opportunity to discuss your business plans.

Having helped many people get their businesses started, I understand that starting a business is a big decision and sometimes takes weeks and even months before you feel comfortable enough to move forward.

Along the way, please understand that I am available to answer any questions that may come up and my commitment to you remains unchanged---  to do whatever possible to help make sure you have the right information to make the best decisions—and hopefully, save you money in the process!

I am available at (855) 787-1921 Monday–Friday from 8 a.m.–5 p.m. PT or email me anytime at BizHelp@legalzoom.com

Finally, if you prefer for me to remove you from my contact list, please just let me know as I want to respect your time.


Katherine C.
Business Account Manager
