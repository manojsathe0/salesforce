    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry. 

On August 13, the Governor of New York signed legislation that will reform the state?s divorce laws significantly.  The week of October 11, 2010, New York joined the other 49 states in allowing couples to choose a ?no fault? divorces, a form of divorce in which neither spouse needs to have misbehaved for the marriage to dissolve.  LegalZoom is currently updating its New York Divorce forms and instructions to include these historic changes.

We appreciate your patience while LegalZoom incorporates the newly released changes into the documents. These changes should be completed on November 12, at which point LegalZoom will contact you to provide an estimate of when your package will be complete.
