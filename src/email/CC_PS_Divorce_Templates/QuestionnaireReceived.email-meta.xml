    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry.

We have received your completed questionnaire.  Processing of your divorce documents will take approximately 5-7 business days.  During this time, we will be reviewing your answers for accuracy and completeness.

In some cases, there may be a delay in completing your final documents due to paperwork changes within the court system or to special requirements requested from a particular county.
