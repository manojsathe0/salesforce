    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom for your Limited Liability Company (LLC) order.  Due to the complexity of filing your LLC as a professional entity in New York, please review the following information.  

Filing as a professional LLC in New York requires 3 stages: (1) obtain consent for your professional LLC from the New York State Education Department (NYSED), (2) file the Articles of Organization with the NY Secretary of State, and (3) provide certified copy of your Articles of Organization to the NYSED.

In order to complete your order, please follow the steps listed below.

Steps to complete Stage 1:
• You must authorize an additional charge of $10.00 for the filing fees to obtain the required consent from the NYSED and to notify the NYSED upon filing of the Articles of Organization.  Please reply to this email with the authorization to charge your credit card on file for the additional fee.
• Fax a copy of your license to (323) 962-8300.  Please include your name and order number on the fax coversheet to ensure proper routing of your document to our processing team.
• In accordance with the NY state law, each member and/or officer of the LLC must be a licensed [business activity].  Please contact us if your corporation does not meet this requirement.   
• If you have additional members and/or officers, we will also need the license for each individual.  You can fax the license(s) to (323) 962-8300.  Please include your name and order number on the fax coversheet to ensure proper routing of your document to our processing team.
• Upon receipt of all license(s), we will prepare and email the Articles of Organization for your signature.  We cannot prepare your Articles of Organization without the proper license on file. 

If you have any questions regarding your order, please contact our {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} at {!snippetVariable.ccphone} or customercare@legalzoom.com.  Please include your order number in your correspondences for prompt service.
