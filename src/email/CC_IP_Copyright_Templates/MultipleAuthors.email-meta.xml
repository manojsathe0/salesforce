    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent order.

During review of your file, the Copyright Office delayed registration of your application because of the following:

The same authors did not write every song.  This indicates that the ownership of all these songs is not the same.

Assuming that the authors own only the songs they wrote, we cannot register all of these songs with one application.  To group these songs and register some of them as collections, complete a separate application for each group of two or more songs written and owned by the same persons.

The Copyright Office will use the fee you already sent for one registration.  Each additional registration will require another $30.00 fee.  Even if you decide that you cannot register all the songs now, we encourage you to make one registration to use the fee we are holding because the filing fee is not refundable.
