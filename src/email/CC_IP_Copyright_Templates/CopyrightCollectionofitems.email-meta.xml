    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for considering LegalZoom for your Intellectual Property needs.

You can register your copyright material of one item for $149.00 or you can register a &quot;collection&quot; of items for $149.00.

A collection of items may include books, songs, photos, or other items, all included under one title. You may register all items in one collection, whether there are 2, 20, or more, as long as all items are listed under a single collection title and arranged in an organized fashion.  

For example:

Collection title: Take a Chance on Life

1. Take a Chance
2. Life Is Chances
3. Whatever It Takes
4. We Will Overcome

If the items in the collection are unpublished, we require 1 copy of each for registration.

If the items in the collection are published, the US Copyright Office requires 2 copies of each for registration, as well as a separate application for every item. To submit a separate application, please log back onto www.LegalZoom.com and submit a new order.

Your work is under copyright protection the moment it is created and fixed in a tangible form that is perceptible either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.
