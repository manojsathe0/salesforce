    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in forming your Doing Business As (DBA) name and in registering a Copyright.  We simplify the process for you by preparing and filing the DBA Statement with your respective state agency, as well as handling any publication requirements, if applicable, as well as conducting a Trademark Search and submitting the Trademark application to the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office (USPTO) for registration.

For your reference, general information regarding establishing a DBA and Trademark registration  has been outlined below.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.
 
DBAs are the simplest and least expensive way to establish a business name in order to operate a business as a sole proprietorship or partnership.  A DBA will allow you to conduct business under the registered name, open a business bank account, enter into contracts, and hire employees.

Trademark registrations typically protect identifying marks used in commerce such as business or product names, slogans, short phrases, logos, and/or acronyms used to represent specific products and/or services.  The federal Trademark registration protects you against an inferior product or service diminishing your reputation or profitability, and allows you to enforce against any infringement upon these rights.

For your convenience, we have listed below all relevant pricing, as well as some additional services that may be beneficial to your business.
