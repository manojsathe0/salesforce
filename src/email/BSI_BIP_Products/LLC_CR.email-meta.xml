    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in forming your Limited Liability Company (LLC) and in registering a Copyright.  We simplify the process for you by preparing and filing the Articles of Organization with your respective Secretary of State, and by drafting a customized, state-specific Operating Agreement for your business, as well as preparing and submitting the Copyright application to the U.S. Copyright Office.

For your reference, general information regarding establishing an LLC has been outlined below.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.
 
An LLC is a state-specific business entity that provides several advantages as a business structure.  Since an LLC is a separate and distinct legal entity, the people involved in the business are provided with personal liability protection, and their assets are shielded from any debts or liabilities that are incurred by the business.  An LLC also provides name exclusivity in the state where it is registered, ensuring that other LLCs cannot use the same business name in the state.  Once an LLC is established, it is able to conduct business, open a bank account, hire employees, and own property.
 
Copyright registrations typically protect works of original authorship, and may include items such as literary works, musical works and sound recordings, still and motion pictures, artistic and creative works, architectural works, and websites.  A registered Copyright allows you to control how the work is reproduced, distributed, and presented publicly, and to enforce against any infringements upon these rights.  Multiple works can be included in a single Copyright submission, as long as they are all in the same state of publication, either published or unpublished.

For your convenience, we have listed below all relevant pricing, as well as some additional services that may be beneficial to your business.
