    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you with the formation of your business.  We simplify the process for you by preparing and filing the necessary documents with your respective state agency, as well as conducting a Trademark Search and submitting the Trademark application to the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office (USPTO) for registration.  You have many options to consider when choosing the best business structure to establish when forming the company. 

To help you make an informed decision, a comparison of the most common business structures to choose from when forming a new business, as well as general information regarding Trademark registration has been outlined below.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.
 
If you intend on conducting business under a name different from your personal name, you may consider filing a DBA (Doing Business As) name.  A DBA will allow you to conduct business under the registered name, open a business bank account, obtain licenses and permits, and hire employees.  A DBA, however, does not provide name exclusivity or liability protection,  thus your personal assets may be liable in the event of a business lawsuit or bankruptcy.

If liability is a concern, you may consider forming a Limited Liability Company (LLC) or Corporation.  Corporations and LLCs are state-specific business entities that provide several advantages as a business structure.  Corporations and LLCs are separate and distinct legal entities that provide the people involved in the business with personal liability protection, separating personal assets from business assets.  This liability protection shields personal assets from any debts or liabilities that are incurred by the business.  Corporations and LLCs also provide name exclusivity in the state in which it is registered, ensuring that other Corporations and LLCs cannot use the same business name in the state.
 
Corporations require more formalities than an LLC.  Corporations are required to designate directors, officers, and shareholders, although one person can hold all necessary positions.  Corporations also require to that annual shareholder and director meetings be held and written minutes of these meetings must be kept on company records.  LLCs do not necessarily have these requirements.

LLCs also provide some tax flexibility.  You may choose to be taxed as a pass-through entity (such as a sole proprietorship or partnership), as a C-Corporation, or as an  S-Corporation.  Pass-through entities typically report business income and expenses with the owner&apos;s personal tax return(s), while Corporations file a separate corporate tax return.  C-Corporations are subject to double taxation, meaning that profits are taxed at the corporate level, and possibly taxed a second time at the individual level.  S-Corporations are subject to single-taxation, and are taxed similarly to pass-through entities, while potentially providing more tax benefits than a pass-through entity.  For further information on tax structure, please consult an accountant or CPA.
 
Trademark registrations typically protect identifying marks used in commerce such as business or product names, slogans, short phrases, logos, and/or acronyms used to represent specific products and/or services.  The federal Trademark registration protects you against an inferior product or service diminishing your reputation or profitability, and allows you to enforce against any infringement upon these rights.

For specific legal or tax advice, we offer our Business Advantage Pro (BAP) membership to provide you with access to licensed attorneys and tax professionals.  This service provides unlimited half-hour consultations on new legal and/or tax matters with licensed attorneys and tax professionals to help you ensure you are making the best choice from a legal and/or tax perspective.  In addition, this membership provides unlimited access to our Legal Forms database, which includes over 100 legal business forms, and one free Copyright registration per month (excluding US Copyright Office filing fees).

The link below gives a detailed comparison between these business structures to assist you in determining the best structure to suit your needs.
