    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in forming your Limited Liability Company (LLC) and in registering a Trademark.  We simplify the process for you by preparing and filing the Articles of Organization with your respective Secretary of State, and by drafting a customized, state-specific Operating Agreement for your business, as well as conducting a Trademark Search and submitting the Trademark application to the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office (USPTO) for registration.

For your reference, general information regarding establishing an LLC and Trademark registration has been outlined below.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.
 
An LLC is a state-specific business entity that provides several advantages as a business structure.  Since an LLC is a separate and distinct legal entity, the people involved in the business are provided with personal liability protection, and their assets are shielded from any debts or liabilities that are incurred by the business.  An LLC also provides name exclusivity in the state where it is registered, ensuring that other LLCs cannot use the same business name in the state.  Once an LLC is established, it is able to conduct business, open a bank account, hire employees, and own property.

Trademark registrations typically protect identifying marks used in commerce such as business or product names, slogans, short phrases, logos, and/or acronyms used to represent specific products and/or services.  The federal Trademark registration protects you against an inferior product or service diminishing your reputation or profitability, and allows you to enforce against any infringement upon these rights.

For your convenience, we have listed below all relevant pricing, as well as some additional services that may be beneficial to your business.
