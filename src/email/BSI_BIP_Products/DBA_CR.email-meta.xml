    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in forming your Doing Business As (DBA) name and in registering a Copyright.  We simplify the process for you by preparing and filing the DBA Statement with your respective state agency, as well as handling any publication requirements, if applicable, as well as preparing and submitting the Copyright application to the U.S. Copyright Office.

For your reference, general information regarding establishing a DBA and Copyright registration  has been outlined below.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.
 
DBAs are the simplest and least expensive way to establish a business name in order to operate a business as a sole proprietorship or partnership.  A DBA will allow you to conduct business under the registered name, open a business bank account, enter into contracts, and hire employees.

Copyright registrations typically protect works of original authorship, and may include items such as literary works, musical works and sound recordings, still and motion pictures, artistic and creative works, architectural works, and websites.  A registered Copyright allows you to control how the work is reproduced, distributed, and presented publicly, and to enforce against any infringements upon these rights.  Multiple works can be included in a single Copyright submission, as long as they are all in the same state of publication, either published or unpublished.
 
For your convenience, we have listed below all relevant pricing, as well as some additional services that may be beneficial to your business.
