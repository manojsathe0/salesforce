    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in forming your Corporation and in registering a Trademark.  We simplify the process for you by preparing and filing the Articles of Incorporation with your respective Secretary of State, and by drafting customized, state-specific Bylaws &amp; Resolutions for your business, as well as conducting a Trademark Search and submitting the Trademark application to the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office (USPTO) for registration.

For your reference, general information regarding establishing a Corporation and Trademark registration has been outlined below.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact a Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.
 
A Corporation is a state-specific business entity that provides several advantages as a business structure.  Corporations are separate and distinct legal entities that provide the people involved in the business with personal liability protection, separating personal assets from business assets.  This liability protection shields personal assets from any debts or liabilities that are incurred by the business.  A Corporation also provides name exclusivity in the state where it is registered, ensuring that other Corporations cannot use the same business name in the state.  Once a Corporation is established, it is able to conduct business, open a bank account, hire employees, and own property.

Trademark registrations typically protect identifying marks used in commerce such as business or product names, slogans, short phrases, logos, and/or acronyms used to represent specific products and/or services.  The federal Trademark registration protects you against an inferior product or service diminishing your reputation or profitability, and allows you to enforce against any infringement upon these rights.

For specific legal or tax advice, we offer our Business Advantage Pro (BAP) membership to provide you with access to licensed attorneys and tax professionals.  This service provides unlimited half-hour consultations on new legal and/or tax matters with licensed attorneys and tax professionals to help you ensure you are making the best choice from a legal and/or tax perspective.  In addition, this membership provides unlimited access to our Legal Forms database, which includes over 100 legal business forms, and one free Copyright registration per month (excluding US Copyright Office filing fees).
 
For your convenience, we have listed below all relevant pricing, as well as some additional services that may be beneficial to your business.
