<![CDATA[<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:10.0pt">Dear
{!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},</p>

<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:10.0pt">Thank you for
contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.&nbsp;
In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in forming your
Non-Profit Corporation and in registering a Copyright.&nbsp; We simplify the process for you by preparing
and filing the Articles of Incorporation with your respective Secretary of
State., and by providing templates for drafting the Bylaws &amp; Resolutions
for the entity, as well as preparing and submitting the Copyright application
to the U.S. Copyright Office.</p>

<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:10.0pt">For your reference,
general information regarding establishing a Non-Profit Corporation has been
outlined below, including information regarding applying for tax-exempt status
for the entity.&nbsp; If you would like to get
specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact a
Business Formation Specialist at the phone number listed below.&nbsp; By speaking with a Specialist will be able to
assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized
package to best benefit your needs.</p>

<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:10.0pt">Non-Profit
Corporations offer several distinct advantages as a business structure.&nbsp; One of these advantages is name protection
within the state of formation, guaranteeing name exclusivity in that state.&nbsp; Another advantage is the personal liability
protection provided to the people involved.&nbsp;
Since the corporation is a separate and distinct legal entity, the
assets of the people involved are shielded from any debts, liabilities, or
lawsuit settlements that the business may incur.&nbsp; </p>

<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:10.0pt">One of the biggest
advantages of a Non-Profit Corporation is the ability to apply for tax exempt
status from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and state government.&nbsp; This tax exempt status allows the Non-Profit
to be exempt from income taxes on any funds coming into the business, and also
allows the donors to the organization to deduct their contributions on their
individual tax returns.&nbsp; Tax exempt
status with the IRS is obtained by applying for a 501(c) designation from the
IRS.&nbsp; We offer preparation services for
this application, in which we will fill out the application for your Non-Profit
based on the information you provide in our online questionnaires, ensuring the
application is filled out properly.</p>

<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:10.0pt">Our 501(c)
Application preparation service makes the process easy for you to apply for tax
exemption for your Non-Profit Corporation.&nbsp;
We prepare the entire Application and provide you step-by-step
instructions on what needs to be submitted to the IRS with the
Application.&nbsp; The IRS has a processing
fee that will be paid at the time the Application is submitted, and this fee
will depend on the projected income of the Non-Profit.&nbsp; If the projected average annual income for
the first four years of the Non-Profitâ€™s existence is $10,000 or less, the IRS
filing fee is $400; otherwise it is $850.&nbsp;
</p>

<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:10.0pt">Copyright
registrations typically protect works of original authorship, and may include
items such as literary works, musical works and sound recordings, still and
motion pictures, artistic and creative works, architectural works, and
websites.&nbsp; A registered Copyright allows
you to control how the work is reproduced, distributed, and presented publicly,
and to enforce against any infringements upon these rights.&nbsp; Multiple works can be included in a single
Copyright submission, as long as they are all in the same state of publication,
either published or unpublished.</p>

<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:10.0pt">For specific legal
or tax advice, we offer our Business Advantage Pro (BAP) membership to provide
you with access to licensed attorneys and tax professionals.&nbsp; This service provides unlimited half-hour
consultations on new legal and/or tax matters with licensed attorneys and tax
professionals to help you ensure you are making the best choice from a legal
and/or tax perspective.&nbsp; In addition,
this membership provides unlimited access to our Legal Forms database, which
includes over 100 legal business forms, and one free Copyright registration per
month (excluding US Copyright Office filing fees).</p>
