    <textOnly>Dear Valued LegalZoom Customer, 

Thank you for your recent inquiry.  In regards to your question, LegalZoom at this time does not offer legal guardianship documents.  You may refer to http://www.findlaw.com or your local state bar association to search for an affordable attorney in your area to assist and advise you on your situation. 

LegalZoom however offers estate distribution documents such as Last Will and Living Trusts that address legal guardianship over minor children or management of a minor child?s assets in the event of your passing.  

I have included a complimentary ?Estate Planning Guide? to help you become more familiar with LegalZoom&apos;s documents. 

Please call us toll-free at (800) 962-7490 if we can be of further assistance. 

Best regards, 

The LegalZoom Team
