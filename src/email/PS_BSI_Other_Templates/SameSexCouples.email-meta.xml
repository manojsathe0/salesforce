    <textOnly>Dear Valued LegalZoom Customer, 

Thank you for your recent inquiry.  In regards to your question, LegalZoom&apos;s documents are able to accommodate same-sex couples/domestic partners.  Although the questionnaire will assume you and your partner to be &quot;husband&quot; and &quot;wife&quot;, or ?spouse?, you may answer the questions as though you were addressed as partners.  You and your partner may assign each other the role of &quot;husband&quot; or &quot;wife&quot; to maintain consistency throughout the questionnaire. In addition, please add a note in the &quot;Special Instructions&quot; box found on the Payment Page about your actual relationship so that your document may be created properly. 

I have included a complimentary ?Estate Planning Guide? to help you become more familiar with LegalZoom&apos;s documents. 

Please call us toll-free at (800) 962-7490 if we can be of further assistance. We look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Best regards, 

The LegalZoom Team
