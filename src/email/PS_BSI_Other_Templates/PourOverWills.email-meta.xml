    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry.

A ?Pour-Over Will? is basically a Last Will and Testament that allows you leave the remainder of your estate (that is not transferred into the trust) to heirs.  This is included with a Living Trust. 

An additional Last Will does not need to be purchased.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}.
