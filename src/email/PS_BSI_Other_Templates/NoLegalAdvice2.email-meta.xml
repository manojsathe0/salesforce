    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry.

LegalZoom is not an attorney and cannot provide legal advice. However, we are always seeking innovative ways for people to get the benefits of the law. While we offer a wide variety of documents and services, people often need the advice and guidance of an attorney.

We are glad to be able to send you this link to a national directory of pre-screened and insured attorneys. Please visit our Attorney Locator page at:

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
