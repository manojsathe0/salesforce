    <textOnly>Dear Valued LegalZoom Customer, 

Thank you for your recent inquiry.  In regards to your question, while LegalZoom tries to anticipate every possible situation in our questionnaires, there are, of course unique circumstances that are unforeseen.  For these incidences, we provide the option of a &quot;Special Directives&quot; field, which will allow you to enter in your wishes exactly as you would like them to appear in your legal document, which may be found towards the end of the online questionnaire.  Typically, customers will use this section to elaborate on anything that has been previously indicated in the document in order to provide clarification and reasons for certain decisions.  Please note that directions regarding funeral, handling of remains, etc., should not be included here.  Instead, LegalZoom offers the convenience of a dedicated funeral section in which you can give details about funeral and other final arrangements.  There is also a &quot;Special Instructions&quot; field located on the Payment Page, in which you may indicate special handling of your document order including mailing instructions, request for a document processor to contact you prior to finalizing your paperwork so that anything not specifically addressed in previous sections may be inputted, etc.

Please call us toll-free at (800) 962-7490 if we can be of further assistance. 

Best regards, 

The LegalZoom Team
