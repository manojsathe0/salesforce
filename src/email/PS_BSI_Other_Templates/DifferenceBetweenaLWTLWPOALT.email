  <td style="padding:15px 15px 15px 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:11.5px; line-height:17px; border:1px solid #CCCCCC;">Dear {!Contact.FirstName},<br/><br/>Thank you for your recent inquiry.<br/><br/>A Last Will and Testament goes into effect once you pass on and ensures that your wishes are carried out and that your estate does not wind up trapped in probate court. {!snippetVariable.wills_library}.<br/><br/>A Living Trust can provide you with more privacy than a will because you don&#8217;t have to register it with the courts in probate. A Living Trust can also help you save in estate taxes. LegalZoom Living Trust Packages include what is called a Pour-Over Will. For more information, click <a href=http://www.legalzoom.com/living-trusts-guide/living-trusts.html>here</a>.<br/><br/>For a comparison between Last Wills and Living Trusts, click <a href=http://www.legalzoom.com/wills-estate-planning/summary-compare-wills.html>here</a>.<br/><br/>A Living Will goes into effect if you are rendered unconscious and unable to communicate your wishes regarding life support and care. For more information, click <a href=http://www.legalzoom.com/wills-guide/importance-of-wills.html>here</a><br/><br/>A Power of Attorney is a document that lets you nominate someone to make financial and other decisions on your behalf. This appointment can take effect immediately, or it can take effect only if you are unable to make those decisions on your own. For example, if you become mentally incapacitated, or if you are leaving the country for a while, you would be unable to make these important choices for yourself. For more information, click <a href=http://www.legalzoom.com/power-of-attorney-guide/power-of-attorney.html>here</a>.<br/><br/>Please do not hesitate to contact us if we can be of further assistance.
