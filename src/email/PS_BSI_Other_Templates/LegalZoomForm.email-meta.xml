    <textOnly>Dear Valued LegalZoom Customer,

Thank you for your interest in LegalZoom&apos;s Forms.  I have attached three documents that you may find useful. 

The LegalZoom Form Glossary gives a brief description of all of our Forms.  The Forms FAQ has a question-and-answer format for common questions.  The Promissory Note Comparison Guide describes the many variations of Promissory Notes that we offer.

These three documents answer most common questions.

To order a LegalZoom Form, simply log on to www.legalzoom.com, select &quot;Forms&quot; from the ?More Legal Documents? tab, and then select the Form that?s right for you.

Please call us toll-free at (800) 962-7490 if we can be of further assistance.  We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

The LegalZoom Team
