  <td style="padding:15px 15px 15px 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:11.5px; line-height:17px; border:1px solid #CCCCCC;">Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},<br/><br/>As an LLC and a Corporation are both state-specific registrations, many LegalZoom customers choose to file in the state in which they will be conducting the bulk of their business. Doing business includes, but is not limited to, opening a business bank account, entering into contracts, owning property, and applying for licenses or permits. Nevada and Delaware are popular states in which to register because these states do not charge a corporate state tax and provide flexibility in terms of business addresses; additionally, these states reputedly have business-friendly laws. <br/><br/>Please note that you must designate a Registered Agent in the state in which you register your LLC or Corporation. The Registered Agent is a person or party designated to receive official correspondence on behalf of your Corporation or LLC. Also, in the event that your Corporation or LLC is ever sued, the Registered Agent is responsible for receiving the subpoena on its behalf. The Registered Agent must be an adult with a physical street address in the state of formation, or it can be an authorized provider like LegalZoom. Many customers choose LegalZoom to serve as the Registered Agent on their behalf as the contact information of the Registered Agent is made public. As such, the Registered Agent is sent a significant amount of unsolicited mail. LegalZoom provides Registered Agent services for an annual fee of $159.00. Additionally, you will be provided with a LegalZoom Compliance Calendar that notifies you of any upcoming filings required to maintain your company.<br/><br/>As LegalZoom is a document preparation and filing company only, we can not provide advice on what state of formation may provide the most advantages for you. For this type of consultation please speak with an attorney or accountant. <br/><br/>Please feel free to contact us at (888) 381-8758 if you have any further questions. Our Business Formations Team business hours are {!snippetVariable.bizbsi_hours}.<br/><br/>Best regards,<br/><br/>{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName}<br/>
