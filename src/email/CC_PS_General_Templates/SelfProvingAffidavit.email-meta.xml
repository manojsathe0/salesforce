    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry.

A self-proving affidavit is a document that is signed by you, your witnesses, and the notary.  Once this is done, it will ensure that your witnesses will not be called into court to testify that they saw you sign the will.
