    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry.

In general, Trademarks protect Names, Slogans, Short Phrases, Logos and Acronyms used for specific products and/or services.  By registering for a federal Trademark, you can protect yourself against the possibility that an inferior product will diminish your reputation or profitability. 
 
Additional information is available online at LegalZoom&apos;s Education Center located on the bottom left hand side of the Trademark Overview page.  

To start your Trademark application, please visit www.LegalZoom.com and fill out our easy online questionnaire. LegalZoom will then prepare and file your application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

The cost to file a Trademark application under one (1) class is:
 
1. Standard Package: $169
2. Plus Package: $289
3. Gold Package: $389

All Trademark prices have an additional $325 dollar government filing fee. Additional classes require an additional fee of $385 per additional class.

All Trademark packages have a 7-10 business day processing time frame. To get started on your order, visit: http://www.legalzoom.com/trademarks/trademarks-pricing.html

Online payments can be made by Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Discover.

Once you submit your application along with your logo and specimen (if applicable) we will begin a trademark search within 24-48 business hours. 
 
If you decide to cancel after we have started a trademark search, all of your charges will be refunded minus the search and any applicable processing fees. Refunds must be requested within 60 days of purchase.
