    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry.

Whether to register the mark with the word ?the? included in the name is entirely up to you.  One thing to keep in mind is that when you apply for a Trademark, you will have to show to the trademark office that you&apos;re either (1) Currently using mark in commerce (provide proof of use now) or (2) have a real intent to use the mark in commerce (provide proof of use later). 

Not only you will need to show you&apos;re using the mark in commerce, but you will also have to submit the proof of how it is used in commerce.  The proof (advertisement flyer or a picture of the product with the mark on it) must match the mark on the application.  In other words, if you are applying for a trademark &quot;ABC,&quot; the proof of use you will submit to the United States Patent and Trademark Office cannot show &quot;The ABC&quot;, as it does not match the Trademark on your application.
