    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry.

Marks in design format contain designs, pictures, artwork or specific fonts that the applicant wishes to protect.  Under a design format, the usage of a mark is limited; the mark will be protected only if it is used EXACTLY the way it appears on the black-and-white logo that is provided to the USPTO.  In other words, the applicant cannot change the font, position or style of the mark without losing protection rights.

On the other hand, if the mark is filed as a typed format, it can be used and altered at the applicant?s discretion, so long as the literal element remains the same.  In other words, the applicant may use the mark in any font or style and it will still be protected.  Typed format applications are usually filed solely to protect the word(s) without any designs or artwork.  Under a typed format, it is unnecessary to submit a black and white copy of the logo.
