    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry.

Any person who contributes original material to the work is considered an author, but the contribution must be more than minimal. For example, writing one sentence in a 20-page manuscript is not enough to be considered an author. 

In addition, someone who makes spelling corrections, transcribes text, or performs other non-creative work would not be considered an author. In cases of works for hire, the &quot;author&quot; is considered to be the employer.

The author is the owner/claimant of the copyright unless the author transfers the copyright to another party (such as a publisher). 

Any other person who contributed original material is considered a joint author. The amount contributed does not have to be equal, but it must be more than minimal.
