  <td style="padding:15px 15px 15px 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:11.5px; line-height:17px; border:1px solid #CCCCCC;">Dear {!Contact.FirstName},<br/><br/>Thank you for your recent inquiry.<br/><br/>LegalZoom can assist you in preparing and filing a provisional application for patent. The total cost including government fees is $309.00.<br/><br/>A provisional application for patent establishes your priority with a &#34;date of invention.&#34; The reason it&#39;s so important to file a provisional application is because Patent Law does not recognize the person who came up with the idea first, but the person who files the patent application first.<br/><br/>The advantage of a provisional application for patent is that it&#39;s much faster and easier to file than a standard patent application. A standard patent application can take months to prepare and can cost $5,000 or more. With a provisional application for patent, you will have 12 months to file a corresponding non-provisional utility patent application and you can legally announce to the world, &#34;Patent pending.&#34; <br/><br/>Additional information is available online at LegalZoom&#8217;s Education Center. Visit www.legalzoom.com and click on the &#8220;Education Center&#8221; tab located in the middle of the homepage. <br/><br/>To view pricing information, please visit <a href=https://www.legalzoom.com/provisional-patents/provisional-patents-pricing.html>here</a><br/><br/>Optional Services:<br/>*Attorney Review and Preparation $329.00 <br/>*Professional Illustration $299.00 <br/>*Patent Search $299.00 <br/><br/>
