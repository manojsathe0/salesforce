    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry. LegalZoom is your premiere legal resource and we have helped thousands like you get the protection that they are looking for.

In order for us to provide you with the best service, please give me a call at 1-800-773-0888 ext. {!User.Extension}. You can also email me your phone number and the best time to reach you.
