    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry.

You can file two applications for the name and for the logo separately, if you will be using them separately.  

Alternatively, you can file one application and put both the name and the logo on that application, however you must be aware that you would have to use them both together at all times to be protected. 

Unfortunately, we can not advise you on your best option because Legalzoom.com Inc., is a legal documentation assistant. We can offer no legal advice, recommendations, mediation or counseling under any circumstance. You will need to make your filing decisions on your own or contact an attorney for specific guidance or advice.
