    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry.

A Trademark Search will identify existing:  Names, Slogans, Short Phrases, Logos and Acronyms.  By applying for a Trademark Search, you can prevent yourself from applying for a Trademark that has been already registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, which can lead to a refusal. If you have already applied for a Trademark, you will be able to view other applications that may be infringing on your mark.
 
You can learn more about pricing and get started with your Trademark Search by clicking here: http://www.legalzoom.com/trademark-search/trademark-search-pricing. 

LegalZoom offers 4 types of searches. The cost to conduct a Trademark Search is: 
 
1. Federal and State Search: $199
2. Comprehensive U.S. Search: $299
3. Worldscan U.S. and International Search: $499
4. A Trademark Logo Search is an additional: $250 (keep in mind Legalzoom does not offer a stand-alone Logo Search. The Logo Search must be bundled with one of the above searches or selected as an add-on within a Trademark application). 

If you decide to bundle the Trademark Search package with a Trademark application you will save $50 dollars off your Trademark Search package price.

After payment is received, Legalzoom will prepare the Search results and forward them to you. All Trademark Search packages have a 7-10 business day processing time frame.

Online payments can be made by Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Discover.
