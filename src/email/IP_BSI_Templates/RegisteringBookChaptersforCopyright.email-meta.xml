    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry.

You can register for Copyright any portion of your book at any time, however, only the portion that you send in to the Library of Congress will be a registered Copyright.  Therefore, if you want to register the complete book for $149.00, then you would want to wait until the book is completed before submitting it.

If you submit chapters of your book, each time you make a submission the cost will be $149.00.

To get started on your Copyright, click on the link below:
