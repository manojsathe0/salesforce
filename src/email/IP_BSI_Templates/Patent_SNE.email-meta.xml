    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry. LegalZoom is your premiere legal resource and we have helped thousands like you get the protection that they are looking for.

There are two different types of patents, a Utility Patent and a Design Patent.  A utility patent is meant to protect the way an invention works, so something that has a unique function, process or method.  A Design Patent is meant to protect the way an invention looks, so something that has a unique outward appearance to a manufacture product.  The provisional application is only meant for inventions that would qualify for a Utility Patent. 

At LegalZoom our goal is to make this process easy on you and provide you with a complete solution that will give you the protection that you need.  In order for us to provide you with the best service, please give me a call at 1-800-773-0888 ext. {!User.Extension}. You can also email me your phone number and the best time to reach you.
