    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry.

LegalZoom can assist you in preparing and filing a provisional application for patent. The total cost including government fees is $309.00.

A provisional application for patent establishes your priority with a &quot;date of invention.&quot; The reason it&apos;s so important to file a provisional application is because Patent Law does not recognize the person who came up with the idea first, but the person who files the patent application first.

The advantage of a provisional application for patent is that it&apos;s much faster and easier to file than a standard patent application. A standard patent application can take months to prepare and can cost $5,000 or more. With a provisional application for patent, you will have 12 months to file a corresponding non-provisional utility patent application and you can legally announce to the world, &quot;Patent pending.&quot;
