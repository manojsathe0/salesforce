• Tax professional advice and consultations. Speak with an experienced tax professional on an unlimited number of new tax issues
• Annual legal checkup with an attorney: Just like getting an annual checkup of your health with your doctor, it’s important to get an annual checkup of important legal documents with an attorney.
