    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry.

Choosing to withhold life support means that the doctor will not give you treatment which only prolongs your life.  These are the machines that force heart to beat, lungs to breathe, etc.  Artificial Food and Water is a liquid food and water that is injected intravenously.

For more specific information, you may wish to contact your physician.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if we can be of further assistance. Simply reply to this email or call us toll free at {!snippetVariable.ccphone}.
 
Best regards,
 
[Your Name]
