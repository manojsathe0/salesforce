    <textOnly>Dear Valued LegalZoom Customer,

Thank you for your recent inquiry. In regards to your question, LegalZoom&apos;s Living Will document covers advance healthcare directives such as the desire to be or not to be sustained on artificial life support in the event of a terminal illness, coma, or vegetative state.  LegalZoom&apos;s Living Will packages also include a complimentary Healthcare Power of Attorney (when purchased together with the Living Will) that allows you to appoint a person to make medical decisions on your behalf when you are unable to.

With LegalZoom, you have the option of creating both a Living Will document and a Healthcare Power of Attorney, or either one for the same price of $39.

I have included a complimentary ?Estate Planning Guide? to help you become more familiar with LegalZoom&apos;s documents. 

Please call us toll-free at (800) 962-7490 if we can be of further assistance.  We look forward to hearing from you soon.
 
Best regards,
 
The LegalZoom Team
