    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry regarding your IRS CP 575 Notice. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has specific rules around what numbers, words and characters are acceptable in a business name when assigning your federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). The only characters the IRS systems can accept in a business name are:

1. Alpha (A-Z)
2. Numeric (0-9)
3. Hyphen (-)
4. Ampersand (&amp;)

The word “The” will be omitted when it is followed by more than one word.

The name the IRS assigns for your business does not affect the legal business name you filed with your state agency.

If you have questions about your EIN, you can call the IRS business help line at (800) 829-4933 Monday–Friday from 7 a.m.–7 p.m. your local time. If you have any questions or would like additional information, simply reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 5 a.m.–8 p.m. PT and weekends from 7 a.m.–4 p.m. PT.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to serving you again soon.
