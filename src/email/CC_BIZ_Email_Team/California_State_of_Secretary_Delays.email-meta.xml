    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your inquiry. You can check the status of your order any time by signing in to your account and clicking the Open Orders tab. The timeline will show the stage of processing your order is in.

Your business formation documents were sent to the California Secretary of State for processing on [date docs sent to SOS]. However, due to state budget cuts and a large backlog, government processing times can take anywhere from 7 to 25 business days. For the latest state processing times for corporate filings (“in person on”), click here.

Once we receive your filed documents back from the state, we conduct a Peace of Mind Review™ and compile your final package to ship to you. We will notify you by email as soon as we receive your filed documents back from the state and when we ship your final package to you.

If you have any questions or would like additional information, simply reply to this email or call us at (800) 773-0888 Monday–Friday from 5 a.m.–8 p.m. PT and weekends from 7 a.m.–4 p.m. PT.

We appreciate you choosing LegalZoom and look forward to serving you again soon.
