    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},


Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in filing your Utility Patent, and moving forward with Step II of the process.  We simplify the process for you by assembling and submitting the Utility Patent application to the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office (USPTO).


For your reference, general information regarding filing a Utility Patent has been outlined below.


Utility Patents typically protect original inventions, unique improvements on existing items, or some methods or processes. Utility Patents grant property rights to the inventor, and prevent other parties from using, making, selling, or importing  the patented item(s) without your permission, and allow you to enforce against any infringement upon these rights.  The term of a Patent is typically 20 years from the date the Patent Application is filed with the USPTO.


Step Two consists of the preparation and drafting of the Utility Patent application and accompanying documents, and electronic filing of the application.  The Utility Patent application is typically submitted to the USPTO within 8-10 weeks of placing the order.  The USPTO may take 12-24 months to complete the filing process.


For your convenience, we have listed all relevant pricing below.
