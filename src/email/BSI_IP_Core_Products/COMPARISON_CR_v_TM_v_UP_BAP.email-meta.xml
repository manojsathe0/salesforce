    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},


Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, we can assist you in registering Copyrights, Trademarks, and/or Patents.  While there may be some similarities among these types of intellectual property protection, they are different and serve different purposes.


To help you make an informed decision, provided below is a comparison of Copyrights, Trademarks, and Patents.


Copyrights typically protect works of original authorship, and may include items such as literary works, musical works and sound recordings, still and motion pictures, artistic and creative works, architectural works, and websites.  A copyright owner can control control how his or her work is reproduced, distributed, and presented publicly, and can enforce against infringements upon these rights.  Note that the Copyright protects the form of expression rather than the subject matter.  For example, a description of a machine could be protected by copyright, but this would only prevent others from copying the description; it would not prevent others from writing their own description, or from making or using the machine itself.


Trademarks typically protect identifying marks used in commerce such as business or product names, slogans, short phrases, logos, and/or acronyms used to represent specific products and/or services.  A trademark helps protect against an inferior product or service diminishing your reputation or profitability, and allows you to enforce against infringement upon these rights.  Although a trademark may be used to prevent others from using a confusingly similar mark, it would not prevent others from making the same goods or from selling the same goods or services under a clearly different mark.


Utility Patents typically protect original inventions, unique improvements on existing items, or some methods or processes. Utility Patents grant property rights to the inventor, and prevents other parties from using, making, selling, or importing  the patented item(s) without your permission, and allows you to enforce against any infringement upon these rights.  The term of a Patent is typically 20 years from the date the Patent Application is filed with the USPTO.


For specific legal or tax advice, we offer our Business Advantage Pro (BAP) membership to provide you with access to licensed attorneys and tax professionals.  This service provides unlimited half-hour consultations on new legal and/or tax matters with licensed attorneys and tax professionals to help you ensure you are making the best choice from a legal and/or tax perspective.  In addition, this membership provides unlimited access to our Legal Forms database, which includes over 100 legal business forms, and one free Copyright registration per month (excluding US Copyright Office filing fees).
