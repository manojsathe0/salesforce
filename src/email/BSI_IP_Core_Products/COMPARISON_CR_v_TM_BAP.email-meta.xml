    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, we can assist you in registering Copyrights and/or Trademarks.  While there may be some similarities among these types of intellectual property protection, they are different and serve different purposes.

To help you make an informed decision, provided below is a comparison of Copyrights and Trademarks.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact an Intellectual Property Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.

Copyright registrations typically protect works of original authorship, and may include items such as literary works, musical works and sound recordings, still and motion pictures, artistic and creative works, architectural works, and websites.  A registered Copyright allows you to control how the work is reproduced, distributed, and presented publicly, and to enforce against any infringements upon these rights.  The Copyright registration protects the form of expression rather than the subject matter.  For example, a description of a machine could be copyrighted, but this would only prevent others from copying the description; it would not prevent others from writing their own description, or from making or using the machine itself.

Trademark registrations typically protect identifying marks used in commerce such as business or product names, slogans, short phrases, logos, and/or acronyms used to represent specific products and/or services.  The federal Trademark registration protects you against an inferior product or service diminishing your reputation or profitability, and allows you to enforce against any infringement upon these rights.  The Trademark registration may be used to prevent others from using a confusingly similar mark;  it would not prevent others from making the same goods or from selling the same goods or services under a clearly different mark.

For specific legal or tax advice, we offer our Business Advantage Pro (BAP) membership to provide you with access to licensed attorneys and tax professionals.  This service provides unlimited half-hour consultations on new legal and/or tax matters with licensed attorneys and tax professionals to help you ensure you are making the best choice from a legal and/or tax perspective.  In addition, this membership provides unlimited access to our Legal Forms database, which includes over 100 legal business forms, and one free Copyright registration per month (excluding US Copyright Office filing fees).
