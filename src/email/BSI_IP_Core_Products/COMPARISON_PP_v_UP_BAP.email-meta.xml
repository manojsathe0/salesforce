    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},


Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in filing your Patent as either a Provisional or Utility (Non-Provisional) Patent Application.  We simplify the process for you by assembling and submitting the Utility Patent Application to the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office (USPTO).


For your reference, general information regarding filing a Patent has been outlined below.


Provisional Patent Applications are intended to establish an initial filing date for your invention, and allows you to legally use the term &quot;patent pending&quot; in conjunction with your invention.  The Provisional Patent Application gives you 12 months to subsequently submit a Utility (Non-Provisional) Patent Application to complete the Patent filing process.  You can also choose to abandon the Provisional Patent Application should you choose not to pursue the protection of the invention with a full Utility Patent Application.  The benefit of the Provisional Patent Application is that it is less expensive initially, and allows you to establish your initial application filing date.


The Utility Patent Application process is a two-step process.  Step One consists of a Patent consultation and review with a registered patent attorney or patent agent, technical Patent illustrations creation and/or review, and an optional comprehensive Patent Search.  Step Two consists of the preparation and drafting of the Utility Patent Application and accompanying documents, and electronic filing of the application.


Upon placing the order for your Patent Application, you will be given instructions describing how to submit supplemental details of your items(s) to LegalZoom, either by directly uploading the file, emailing copies, or submitting hard copies by mail.  Provisional Patent applications are typically submitted to the USPTO within 2-3 weeks of placing the order, and are effective immediately upon submission.  The Utility Patent Application is typically submitted to the USPTO within 8-10 weeks of placing the order, and the USPTO may take 12-24 months to complete the filing process.


For specific legal or tax advice, we offer our Business Advantage Pro (BAP) membership to provide you with access to licensed attorneys and tax professionals.  This service provides unlimited half-hour consultations on new legal and/or tax matters with licensed attorneys and tax professionals to help you ensure you are making the best choice from a legal and/or tax perspective.  In addition, this membership provides unlimited access to our Legal Forms database, which includes over 100 legal business forms, and one free Copyright registration per month (excluding US Copyright Office filing fees).


For your convenience, we have listed all relevant pricing below.
