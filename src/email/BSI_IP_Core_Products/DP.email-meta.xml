    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in filing your Design Patent.  We simplify the process for you by preparing and submitting the Design Patent application to the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office (USPTO) for registration.

For your reference, general information regarding filing a Design Patent has been outlined below.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact an Intellectual Property Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist, we will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.

Design Patents typically protect the appearance or aesthetic qualities of a manufactured item.  Design Patent filings protect against other parties manufacturing items that are confusingly similar to your protected design, and also allows you to enforce against any infringement upon these rights. 

Upon placing the order for your Design Patent, you will be given instructions describing how to submit supplemental details to LegalZoom, either by directly uploading the file, emailing copies, or submitting hard copies by mail.  The Design Patent application is typically submitted to the USPTO within 3 weeks of placing the order.  The USPTO may take 12-18 months to complete the registration process, however the protection would be based upon the date the application is submitted to the USPTO.
