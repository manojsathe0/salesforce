    <textOnly>URGENT ACTION REQUIRED: Your Legalzoom Order # XXXXXXX ? First set of questions for your 501c3

Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom for your 501c3 order.  Please follow the steps listed below to complete your order.

Next steps:

-Complete the attached questions using Microsoft Word
-Review and revise the attached budget using Microsoft Excel
-Email completed responses as attachments in MS Word/MS Excel format to nonprofit@legalzoom.com.  

Using any other software formats will result in delays with your order.  In addition, we cannot accept these documents via fax and/or hardcopy mail.

For MAC users:

-Please ensure the name of the file has the PC-appropriate extension (i.e. Document.DOC or Document.XLS) 
-Save documents as an appropriate file type

It is very important that your answers are complete and detailed as much as possible.  IRS carefully scrutinizes every application before approval and does not accept generalization.  If your answers are generic and/or lack detail, IRS can delay the approval of your 501c3.  

Your urgent action will enable us to complete your order in a timely manner

Note: We cannot proceed without your response
