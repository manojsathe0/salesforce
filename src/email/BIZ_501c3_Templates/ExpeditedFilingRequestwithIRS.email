  <td style="padding:15px 15px 15px 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:11.5px; line-height:17px; border:1px solid #CCCCCC;">Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},<br/><br/>Thank you for your inquiry regarding an expedited filing with the IRS for your 501c3 order. While Legalzoom does not have the authority to request an expedited filing of a 501c3 with the IRS, there are steps that might be applicable to your situation.<br/><br/>In general, applications are processed in the order received by the IRS. In some occasions, the IRS will review a case in an expedited manner. However, this requires a compelling reason to process the case ahead of others.<br/><br/>Compelling reasons include the following:<br/><ul><li>A pending grant, where failure to secure the grant will have an adverse impact on the organization&#39;s ability to continue operating.<br/><li>A newly created organization providing disaster relief to victims of emergencies.<br/><li>IRS errors have caused undue delays in issuing a determination letter.<br/><li>For a pending grant, the following specific information would help support a request for expedited processing:<br/><li>The name of the person or organization committed to giving the grant or asset,<br/><li>The amount of the grant or the value of the asset,<br/><li>The date the grant will be forfeited or permanently redirected to another organization,<br/><li>The impact on the organization&#39;s operations if it does not receive the grant/asset, and<br/><li>The signature of a principal officer or authorized representative.<br/></ul>A request for expedited processing must be made in writing and must fully explain the compelling reason. Granting expedited processing is at the discretion of the IRS.<br/><br/>For expedited handling, after an application has been filed a written request for expedite handling must be sent to the following address:<br/><br/>Internal Revenue Service<br/>P.O. Box 2508<br/>Room 4024<br/>Cincinnati, OH 45201<br/><br/>Express mail or a hand-delivery service must be sent to the following address:<br/><br/>Internal Revenue Service<br/>550 Main Street<br/>Room 4024<br/>Cincinnati, OH 45202<br/><br/>If you have any additional questions regarding expedited 501c3 filing, please contact the IRS. You can also contact our Customer Care Department at (800) 773-0888 or nonprofit@legalzoom.com. However, please be advised that Legalzoom does not have any affiliation or relationship with the IRS and cannot request your order to be expedited.<br/><br/>Best regards,<br/><br/>{!snippetVariable.cccontactline} {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} {!snippetVariable.ccassistline} {!snippetVariable.ccphone}. {!snippetVariable.ourrr} {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full} {!snippetVariable.ccbizhourline} {!snippetVariable.cchours}.<br/><br/>{!snippetVariable.ccsincerely}<br/><br/>{!snippetVariable.cclegalzoomline} {!snippetVariable.cc_dept_full}<br/>{!snippetVariable.ccphone} | {!snippetVariable.lz_address}<br/>{!snippetVariable.lz_website}<br/>
