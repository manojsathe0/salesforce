    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for your inquiry regarding an expedited filing with the IRS for your 501c3 order.  While Legalzoom does not have the authority to request an expedited filing of a 501c3 with the IRS, there are steps that might be applicable to your situation.  

In general, applications are processed in the order received by the IRS.  In some occasions, the IRS will review a case in an expedited manner.  However, this requires a compelling reason to process the case ahead of others.  

Compelling reasons include the following:
?A pending grant, where failure to secure the grant will have an adverse impact on the organization&apos;s ability to continue operating. 
?A newly created organization providing disaster relief to victims of emergencies.
?IRS errors have caused undue delays in issuing a determination letter.

For a pending grant, the following specific information would help  support a request for expedited processing:
?The name of the person or organization committed to giving the grant or asset,
?The amount of the grant or the value of the asset,
?The date the grant will be forfeited or permanently redirected to another organization,
?The impact on the organization&apos;s operations if it does not receive the grant/asset, and
?The signature of a principal officer or authorized representative.

A request for expedited processing must be made in writing and must fully explain the compelling reason.  Granting expedited processing is at the discretion of the IRS.

Where to send request for expedited handling:
After an application has been filed, a written request for expedite handling must be sent to the following address:

Internal Revenue Service
P.O. Box 2508
Room 4024
Cincinnati, OH 45201

Express mail or a hand-delivery service must be sent to the following address:
Internal Revenue Service
550 Main Street
Room 4024
Cincinnati, OH 45202

If you have any additional questions regarding expedited 501c3 filing, please contact the IRS.  You can also contact our Customer Care Department at (800) 773-0888 or nonprofit@legalzoom.com.  However, please be advised that Legalzoom does not have any affiliation or relationship with the IRS and cannot request your order to be expedited.
