    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

During a recent systems upgrade, we discovered that some of our customers were overcharged by $30 when placing an order for our Joint or AB Living Trust products. You were one of the impacted customers, and as a result, we will be refunding your account the $30. This unconditional refund will be issued back to you in the same manner in which it was received. Please allow 5 to 7 business days for this transaction to appear on your account.  We appreciate the opportunity to serve you and regret the billing error. We hope you will continue to look to LegalZoom for all of your future legal document needs.
