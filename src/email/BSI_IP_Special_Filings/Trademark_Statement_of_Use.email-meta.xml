Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in filing the Statement of Use for your Trademark Registration.  We simplify the process for you by preparing and filing the Statement of Use application with the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office (USPTO).

If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact an Intellectual Property Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist, we will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.

The Statement of Use is required to provide proof to the USPTO that you are actively using your Trademark to sell the goods or services listed in your Trademark application.
