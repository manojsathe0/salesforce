    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
 
Thank you for contacting LegalZoom for your business needs.  In regard to your inquiry, LegalZoom can assist you in submitting the Section 9 filing (Trademark Renewal) for your Trademark registration.  We simplify the process for you by preparing and filing the Section 9 application with the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office (USPTO).
 
For your reference, general information regarding Section 9 filings has been outlined below.  If you would like to get specific, detailed information on your personal situation, please contact an Intellectual Property Specialist at the phone number listed below.  By speaking with a Specialist, we will be able to assist with answering further questions, as well as building a customized package to best benefit your needs.

The Section 9 filing must be filed between the 9th and 10th year following your Trademark&apos;s registration date, and every 10 years thereafter, to keep it active with the USPTO.  If the Section 9 filing is not submitted, the Trademark may be abandoned by the USPTO.

For your convenience, we have listed all relevant pricing below.
