    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom for your DBA order. Please follow the steps listed below to complete your order.

Next steps:
• Do not make any changes to the attached document as it will result in delays with your order. If you need to make changes, please contact our Customer Support.
• Print two (2) copies of the document on white paper using black ink. Please do not use color ink. 
• In the presence of a Notary Public, please sign your name in black ink on all copies in section #3 of the form. The documents must then be properly notarized. 
• Secondarily, it is important that the Notary Public apply their stamp/seal to the left of their signature line. 
• Mail the documents to our address listed below. Please include a valid US form of identification for all listed registrant(s). This identification needs to be a photo ID, and it must clearly represent the name of any listed registrant and their corresponding residence address. Examples of acceptable identification would be a copy of a driver’s license or passport. 

Please note that we cannot accept faxes of the DBA application as the State office will only accept original signed documents.
