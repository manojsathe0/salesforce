Please follow the steps listed below to complete your order:<br/>

<ol>

<li>Do not make any changes to the attached document as it will result in delays with your order. If you need to make changes, please contact our Customer Support.

<li>Identify the two types of documents you have in your packet. First are DBA forms, these applications are used to officially register your business. The other type is an Affidavit of Identity, used to prove your identity. The Affidavit of Identity has a place for a public notary’s seal. You will treat these documents differently in later steps, so make sure you can tell them apart. If you have any questions, contact our Customer Support.

<li>Print four (4) copies of the DBA forms and print one (1) copy of the Affidavit document. Print these copies on white paper using black ink. Please do not use color ink.

<li>Have the copies of the Affidavit of Identity notarized by a notary public. <b> Use only the documents provided</b>, using other documents could delay your order. Follow the notary’s instructions for signing the documents. Signing ahead of time won’t help you, as the notary has to verify your signature as you sign. The notary will apply their stamp/seal when they are satisfied. To find out more about notarization, see <a href="http://www.legalzoom.com/notary">the LegalZoom Notary Center.</a><li>

<il>Sign the Fictitious Business Name Statement as the registrant. Use only black ink when signing.

<li>Mail the notarized and signed documents to our address listed below. Please note that we cannot accept faxes as the state office will only accept original signed documents.</ol>
