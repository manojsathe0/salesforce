    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom for your DBA order.  Please follow the steps listed below to complete your order.

Next steps:
•  Do not make any changes to the attached document as it will result in delays with your order.  If you need to make changes, please contact our Customer Support.
•  Print two (2) copies of the document on white paper using black ink.  Please do not use color ink.
•  In the presence of a Notary Public, please have all listed partners sign their names in black ink on all copies where indicated.  The documents must then be properly notarized.
•  There are 2 different sections for Notary Acknowledgement.  Only 1 is to be completed.  If the documents are being Notarized in the state of New York, please only have the Section identified as ?Acknowledgement in New York State? completed, located on 1st page of the application.  If the documents are being notarized outside the state of New York, please only have the Section identified as ?Acknowledgement Outside New York State? completed, located on 2nd page of the application.
•  Secondarily, it is important that the Notary Public apply their stamp/seal below their signature line.  
•  Mail the documents to our address listed below.  Please note that we cannot accept faxes as the County office will only accept original signed documents.
