    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for choosing LegalZoom for your DBA order.  Please follow the steps listed below to complete your order.

Next steps:
•  Do not make any changes to the attached document as it will result in delays with your order.  If you need to make changes, please contact our Customer Support.
•  Print two (2) copies of the document on white paper using black ink.  Please do not use color ink.
•  In the presence of a Notary Public, please have all listed partners sign their names in black ink on all copies where indicated.  The documents must then be properly notarized.
•  There are 2 different sections for Notary Acknowledgement.  Only 1 is to be completed.  If the documents are being Notarized in the state of New York, please only have the Section identified as &quot;Acknowledgement in New York State&quot; completed, located on 1st page of the application.  If the documents are being notarized outside the state of New York, please only have the Section identified as &quot;Acknowledgement Outside New York State&quot; completed, located on 2nd page of the application.
•  Secondarily, it is important that the Notary Public apply their stamp/seal below their signature line.  
•  Mail the documents to our address listed below.  Please include a form of identification for all listed registrant(s).  This identification need not be a photo ID, but it must clearly represent the name of any listed registrant and their corresponding residence address.  Examples of acceptable identification would be a copy of a utility bill or a driver?s license.   Please note that we cannot accept faxes of the DBA application as the County office will only accept original signed documents.
