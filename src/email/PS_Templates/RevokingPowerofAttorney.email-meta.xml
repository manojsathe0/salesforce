    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry.

You have a choice of when Power of Attorney ends. It could end either if you become mentally incapacitated, or with a Durable Power of Attorney, it can continue until death. That means that you cannot give your agent authority to handle things after your death, such as paying debts, making funeral or burial arrangements or transferring your property to the people who inherit it. A Last Will and Testament addresses those issues.

Your Durable Power of Attorney also ends if:

* You revoke it. As long as you are mentally competent, you can revoke a Durable Power of Attorney at any time.

* A court invalidates your document. This rarely happens, but a court may declare that you were mentally incompetent when you signed it, or that you were the victim of fraud.

* You get a divorce. In a handful of states, such as Alabama, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin, if your spouse is your agent, your ex-spouse&apos;s authority is automatically terminated.
